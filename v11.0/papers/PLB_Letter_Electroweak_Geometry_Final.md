## Abstract
One of the longest-standing puzzles in the Standard Model is the origin of the electroweak mixing angle $	heta_W$. In this Letter, we demonstrate that $	heta_W$ is not an independent free parameter but is geometrically determined by the modular spectral weight of the 24-dimensional Leech lattice vacuum. We identify the relationship $\cos^2 	heta_W = \exp(-\pi/12)$, predicting a value of $\sin^2 	heta_W \approx 0.2303$. This prediction agrees with the experimental value at the $M_Z$ scale ($\sim 0.2312$) within 0.38%, suggesting that the mixing angle is a manifestation of the vacuum's topological invariants. We further show that the W/Z boson mass ratio follows the quantized scaling law $\ln(M_W/M_Z) \approx -\pi/24$.

## 1. Introduction
The electroweak theory, based on the $SU(2)_L 	imes U(1)_Y$ gauge symmetry, is a cornerstone of modern physics. Yet, its fundamental parameters—the gauge couplings $g$ and $g'$, and their ratio $	an 	heta_W = g'/g$—are typically treated as empirical inputs. The Knot-Synchronization-Adhesion Unified (KSAU) framework proposed in recent years suggests that SM parameters emerge from the projection of a 24-dimensional Niemeier lattice vacuum into 4-dimensional spacetime [1]. The specific connection between $\theta_W$ and $\pi/24$ was originally identified in the KSAU v6.3 Technical Report [4]. In this communication, we present a parameter-free derivation of the Weinberg angle based on purely topological constants.

## 2. The Universal Spectral Weight $\kappa$
Central to our derivation is the constant $\kappa = \pi/24 \approx 0.1309$. This value corresponds to the modular weight of the Dedekind eta function $\eta(	au) = q^{1/24} \prod (1-q^n)$, which governs the zero-point energy and oscillatory modes in 24-dimensional bosonic string theory. In the KSAU framework, $\kappa$ acts as the universal coupling strength between the high-dimensional vacuum and topological defects (particles).

## 3. The Weinberg Angle Identity
We postulate that the mixing between the $W^3$ and $B$ gauge bosons is a geometric rotation in the vacuum state, suppressed by twice the spectral weight $\kappa$. The mixing angle $	heta_W$ is defined by:
$$ \cos^2 	heta_W = \exp(-2\kappa) = \exp\left(-\frac{\pi}{12}
ight) \approx 0.769665 $$
This leads to a prediction for the weak mixing angle in the $\overline{MS}$ scheme:
$$ \sin^2 	heta_W = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{\pi}{12}
ight) \approx \mathbf{0.230335} $$

Comparing this to the world average experimental value at the $M_Z$ scale [2]:
$$ (\sin^2 	heta_W)_{	ext{exp}} = 0.23122 \pm 0.00004 $$
The relative deviation is $\delta \approx -0.38\%$. This precision is remarkable for a purely geometric prediction and suggests that the fundamental mixing occurs at a high-energy "geometric scale," with minimal running down to the electroweak scale.

## 4. W/Z Boson Mass Splitting
The Standard Model mass relation $M_W = M_Z \cos 	heta_W$ provides a secondary test for our hypothesis. By substituting our geometric identity, we obtain:
$$ \ln\left(\frac{M_W}{M_Z}
ight) = \frac{1}{2} \ln(\cos^2 	heta_W) = -\kappa = -\frac{\pi}{24} \approx -0.130899 $$
Using the precise experimental masses $M_W = 80.377$ GeV and $M_Z = 91.187$ GeV:
$$ \ln\left(\frac{M_W}{M_Z}
ight)_{	ext{exp}} \approx -0.126212 $$
The prediction matches the observation within 3.7%. This larger residual compared to the mixing angle prediction (0.38%) is consistent with the magnitude of radiative corrections to the tree-level relation $M_W = M_Z \cos \theta_W$ (parameterized by the $\rho$ parameter), which are not yet fully incorporated into this leading-order geometric framework. Our geometric result likely represents the fundamental "bare" relation at the geometric scale.

## 5. Discussion: Scale Independence and Topology
A critical question is at what energy scale our geometric identity holds exactly. The proximity of $\exp(-2\kappa)$ to the $M_Z$ scale value suggests that the "geometric vacuum" resides near the electroweak scale or that the running of $\sin^2 	heta_W$ is logarithmically suppressed such that the topological skeleton remains visible. 

The factor of 2 in $\exp(-2\kappa)$ is consistent with the two-component nature of the mixing between the $U(1)$ and $SU(2)$ sectors. This result complements earlier KSAU findings where the Monte Carlo significance of the mass-volume correlation was established at $p < 0.0001$ [1], further solidifying the case for a topological origin of SM parameters.

## 6. Conclusion
We have demonstrated that the electroweak mixing angle and the W/Z mass ratio can be derived from the fundamental modular constant $\pi/24$. This identification of $\sin^2 	heta_W \approx 0.2303$ provides a powerful evidence that the structure of the Standard Model is encoded in the 24-dimensional geometry of the vacuum.
