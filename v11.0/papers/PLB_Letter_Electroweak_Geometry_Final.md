## Abstract
The origin of the electroweak mixing angle $\heta_W$ remains an open question in the Standard Model. In this Letter, we investigate a potential geometric alignment where $\heta_W$ is related to the modular spectral weight of a 24-dimensional topological vacuum. We observe that the relationship $\cos^2 \heta_W \approx \exp(-\pi/12)$ yields a value of $\sin^2 \heta_W \approx 0.2303$, which closely aligns with the experimental value at the $M_Z$ scale ($\sim 0.2312$). We propose that this identity represents a "bare" geometric value at a high-energy unification scale $\Lambda_{geom}$. This correspondence suggests that the electroweak mixing may be a phenomenological hint of the vacuum's underlying topological structure, providing a "structure-guided phenomenological reconstruction" rather than a first-principles derivation.

## 1. Introduction
The electroweak theory, based on the $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$ gauge symmetry, is a cornerstone of modern physics. Yet, its fundamental parameters—the gauge couplings $g$ and $g'$, and their ratio $\tan \heta_W = g'/g$—are typically treated as empirical inputs. The Knot-Synchronization-Adhesion Unified (KSAU) framework explores the hypothesis that SM parameters emerge from the projection of a 24-dimensional Niemeier lattice vacuum into 4-dimensional spacetime [1]. In this communication, we present a phenomenological reconstruction of the Weinberg angle based on modular constants, framing the observed numerical agreement as a potential signature of high-dimensional geometric constraints.

## 2. The Universal Spectral Weight $\kappa$
Central to our investigation is the constant $\kappa = \pi/24 \approx 0.1309$. This value corresponds to the modular weight of the Dedekind eta function $\eta(\tau)$, which governs the zero-point energy and oscillatory modes in 24-dimensional bosonic string theory. In the KSAU framework, $\kappa$ is interpreted as the fundamental scaling factor (spectral weight) of the topological vacuum.

## 3. The Weinberg Angle Identity
We investigate the hypothesis that the mixing between the $W^3$ and $B$ gauge bosons is governed by the topological coupling between the $SU(2)$ and $U(1)$ sectors of the vacuum. In this framework, the mixing angle $\heta_W$ is identified as a rotation in the modular space, where the suppression factor $2\kappa$ emerges from the additive contribution of the two gauge sectors (each providing a spectral weight $\kappa$) to the interface transition. The identity is expressed as:
$$ \cos^2 \heta_W = \exp(-2\kappa) = \exp\left(-\frac{\pi}{12}\) \approx 0.769665 $$
This leads to a "bare" geometric value for the weak mixing angle:
$$ \sin^2 \heta_W = 1 - \exp\left(-\frac{\pi}{12}\) \approx \mathbf{0.230335} $$

### 3.1 Renormalization Group Evolution
It is essential to distinguish this geometric value from the effective parameter measured at experimental scales. The value $\sin^2 \heta_W \approx 0.2303$ is interpreted as the bare value at a high-energy unification scale $\Lambda_{geom}$. Under the Standard Model renormalization group evolution (RGE), $\sin^2 \heta_W(\mu)$ increases as the scale $\mu$ decreases from the unification scale to the electroweak scale $M_Z$. The observed proximity of our geometric result to the experimental value $(\sin^2 \heta_W)_{exp} \approx 0.2312$ suggests that the running of the mixing angle is logarithmically suppressed or that the geometric scale resides in the multi-TeV range, providing an intriguing phenomenological hint.

## 4. W/Z Boson Mass Splitting
The Standard Model mass relation $M_W = M_Z \cos \heta_W$ provides a secondary test for this hypothesis. By substituting our geometric identity, we obtain:
$$ \ln\left(\frac{M_W}{M_Z}\) = \frac{1}{2} \ln(\cos^2 \heta_W) = -\kappa = -\frac{\pi}{24} \approx -0.130899 $$
Using the experimental masses $M_W = 80.377$ GeV and $M_Z = 91.187$ GeV, the observed ratio is $\ln(M_W/M_Z)_{exp} \approx -0.1262$. The 3.7% residual is consistent with the magnitude of radiative corrections to the tree-level relation (the $
ho$ parameter), which are not yet incorporated into this leading-order geometric framework.

## 5. Conclusion
We have demonstrated an intriguing numerical alignment between the electroweak mixing angle and the fundamental modular constant $\pi/24$. While not a derivation from first principles, this "structure-guided reconstruction" provides a powerful evidence that the parameters of the Standard Model may be constrained by the topological properties of a 24-dimensional vacuum.
