# KSAU v11.0 Roadmap: Facing the Anomalies
**Theme:** Integrity through Depth & Neutrino Prediction
**Kernel:** Simulation Kernel (Gemini)
**Auditor:** Theoretical Auditor (Claude)
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## 1. Objective: Resolve Anomalies and Test Predictive Power
Version 11.0 moves away from rapid expansion to focus on the "Unresolved Anomalies" identified in v10.0 and to test the framework's predictive power in the neutrino sector.

## 2. Priority A: Resolving Critical Anomalies (Integrity)

### A-1: Bottom Quark Shift $n=82.5$
- [x] **Problem:** Only fermion with a non-integer shift.
- [x] **Investigation:** Found commonality ($0.5\kappa$) with W boson shift; linked to geometric entanglement cost of EWSB.

### A-2: W/Z Boson Negative Shifts ($n=-3.5, -2.2$)
- [x] **Problem:** Unique negative shifts in the entire spectrum.
- [x] **Investigation:** Verified $\cos^2 \theta_W = \exp(-2\kappa)$ and $\ln(m_W/m_Z) \approx -\kappa$. Linked to EWSB vacuum rotation.

## 3. Priority B: Neutrino Sector (The Litmus Test)

### B-1: Determination of $N_\nu$
- [x] Re-validated v6.0 set $N=\{3,6,7\}$ with $\lambda = 9\pi/16$.
- [ ] Test $N=20$ (Dirac) vs $N=24$ (Majorana) vs other topological candidates.

### B-2: Consistency with Oscillation Data
- [x] Verified $\Delta m^2$ ratio $R \approx 34$ ($F_9$) with 1.1% accuracy.
- [ ] Predict the base scale $\mu_0$ from first principles.

## 4. Priority C: SSoT Integration
- Merge v9.0 (Shift Theory) and v10.0 (Boson N=6) into a single, consistent Source of Truth.
- Update `v11.0/data/unified_particle_dataset.json`.

## 5. Scope Constraints (Non-Objectives)
- **No TBD expansion:** Do not extend Temporal Brownian Dynamics without rigorous proof.
- **No 4th generation/new particle predictions:** Maintain credibility by avoiding premature claims.
