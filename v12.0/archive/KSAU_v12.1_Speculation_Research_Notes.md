# [WARNING] Speculative Research Notes: Toward a Future Theory of Mass Shifts
**Status:** ARCHIVED - UNSUBSTANTIATED HYPOTHESIS
**Original Date:** February 15, 2026
**Archive Note:** This document contains speculative patterns and metaphorical interpretations (Spinor Shift, A5 Mixing) identified by the Simulation Kernel. These claims currently LACK mathematical derivation and are NOT approved for scientific publication. They are preserved here solely as working notes for future long-term research.

## 1. Observed Patterns (Phenomenology only)
We identify that non-integer mass shifts exhibit fractional components (1/2, 4/5, 1/8) in units of $\kappa$. 

## 2. Conjectural Interpretations (UNPROVEN)
- **Spinor Shift (1/2):** Speculated to relate to the spin-1/2 double cover in electroweak coupling.
- **A5 Mixing (4/5):** Speculated to relate to the icosahedral symmetry group.
- **Scalar Residue (1/8):** Speculated to relate to Higgs field degrees of freedom.

## 3. Critical Failures and Missing Rigor
- **No QFT Derivation:** The connection between "modular weight" and "physical spin" is metaphorical and lacks a field-theoretic proof.
- **Circular Reasoning:** The choice of fractions was influenced by the target data (ad-hoc fitting).
- **Inconsistency:** The Higgs residue (0.125) differs from the observed value (0.132) by ~4%, yet was claimed as a "match."

## 4. Conclusion
Do not reference these notes as established KSAU theory. Rigorous derivation of these values remains a multi-year research objective.
