## 1. Objective: Building the Foundation
Version 12.0 is transitioned into a long-term research phase. We move away from rapid phenomenological fitting to build the mathematical foundations required for first-principles derivation. No claims of "breakthroughs" will be made without rigorous proof.

## 2. Priority 1: Mathematical Foundations (12+ Months)
- **Task 1.1:** Rigorous derivation of $\kappa = \pi/24$ from the 24D vacuum partition function.
- **Task 1.2:** Formalize the 24D $\to$ 4D projection operator $\mathcal{P}$ using Leech Lattice subgroup theory.
- **Task 1.3:** Map Standard Model flavor symmetries ($SU(3), SU(2), U(1)$) to specific Niemeier lattice stabilizers.

## 3. Priority 2: Electroweak Coupling Theory
- **Task 2.1:** Derive the $0.5\kappa$ and $0.8\kappa$ residues from field-theoretic calculations (avoiding metaphors).
- **Task 2.2:** Explain the Weinberg angle $\exp(-2\kappa)$ as a topological linking probability.

## 4. Priority 3: Absolute Scale Research
- **Task 3.1:** Long-term investigation into the derivation of $C_{universal}$ from lattice invariants.
- **Task 3.2:** Verify the neutrino base scale $\mu_0$ from the Leech lattice minimum norm (without post-hoc fitting).

## 5. Strategic Pivot
The immediate focus of the KSAU project is the **publication of v11.0 results** (Weinberg Angle and W/Z splitting), which have been rigorously verified and meet scientific standards. All v12.0 activities are now in "Internal Research" status.
