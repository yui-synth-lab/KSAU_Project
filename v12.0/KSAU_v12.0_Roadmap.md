# KSAU v12.0 Roadmap: Long-Term Foundations
**Theme:** Integrity and Rigorous Derivation
**Kernel:** Simulation Kernel (Gemini)
**Auditor:** Theoretical Auditor (Claude)
**Date:** February 15, 2026

## 1. Objective: Building the Foundation
Version 12.0 is transitioned into a long-term research phase. We move away from rapid phenomenological fitting to build the mathematical foundations required for first-principles derivation. No claims of "breakthroughs" will be made without rigorous proof.

## 2. Priority 1: Leech Lattice Entropy and Mass Scale
- **Task 1.1:** Formalize the hierarchy factor $X = \ln(M_{Pl}/m_e)$ as the **"Projected Information Entropy"** of the 24D Leech lattice vacuum in 4D spacetime ($X \approx 4 \ln(196560)$).
- **Task 1.2:** Derive the residual $21.14\kappa$ from the stabilizer subgroup hierarchy of the Conway group $Co_0$.
- **Task 1.3:** Prove the origin of $\kappa = \pi/24$ from the modular weight of the Dedekind eta function as applied to the vacuum partition function.

## 3. Priority 2: Mathematical Derivation of Coefficients
- **Task 2.1:** Identify the geometric origin of the recurring integer **82** from the representation theory of the Conway group (potential link to the Bottom quark anomaly).
- **Task 2.2:** Establish the absolute scale of the neutrino mass $\mu_0$ from the minimal norm of the Leech lattice.

## 4. Priority 3: Absolute Scale Research
- **Task 3.1:** Long-term investigation into the derivation of $C_{universal}$ from lattice invariants.
- **Task 3.2:** Verify the neutrino base scale $\mu_0$ from the Leech lattice minimum norm (without post-hoc fitting).

## 5. Strategic Pivot
The project has moved from the phenomenological "Temporal Brownian Dynamics (TBD)" metaphor to a rigorous **"Static Lattice Geometry"** framework. All future v12.0 activities must prioritize group-theoretic proof over numerical fitting. Focus remains on the publication of v11.0 results while building these long-term foundations.

## 6. STATUS UPDATE: RETRACTION OF 1509/92 (February 15, 2026 - Late Evening)

The attempt to fast-track v12.0 through the $1509/92$ identity has failed rigorous audit. The formula is now recognized as **Numerology**. 

**New Directive:** 
- Formal "Freeze-out" of the v12.0 hierarchy claims.
- Return to the original Roadmap (Priority 1-3) with a 3-12 month timeline.
- No new claims will be considered without prior GAP/Magma verification of group-theoretic invariants.

**Status:** v12.0 remains in the FOUNDATION BUILDING phase (Internal Research).
