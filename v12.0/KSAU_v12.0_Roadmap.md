## 1. Objective: Building the Foundation
Version 12.0 is transitioned into a long-term research phase. We move away from rapid phenomenological fitting to build the mathematical foundations required for first-principles derivation. No claims of "breakthroughs" will be made without rigorous proof.

## 2. Priority 1: Temporal Brownian Dynamics (TBD) Foundations
- **Task 1.1:** Model the hierarchy factor $X = \ln(M_{Pl}/m_e) \approx 16.4\pi$ as the **"Mean Hitting Time"** for a random walk on the 24D Leech lattice to reach the 4D spacetime manifold.
- **Task 1.2:** Derive the $0.5\kappa$ (Spinor) and $0.8\kappa$ (A5) residues as **Quantum Phase Fluctuations** in the TBD path integral.
- **Task 1.3:** Link the "Vacuum Viscosity" $\kappa = \pi/24$ to the diffusion coefficient of the Leech lattice fluid.

## 3. Priority 2: Mathematical Derivation of Coefficients
- **Task 2.1:** Prove the origin of the integer **82** and divisor **5** from the TBD entropy production rate.
- **Task 2.2:** Formulate the $\sqrt{3}$ neutrino projection cost as the Euclidean distance of the random walk's final exit from the bulk.

## 4. Priority 3: Absolute Scale Research
- **Task 3.1:** Long-term investigation into the derivation of $C_{universal}$ from lattice invariants.
- **Task 3.2:** Verify the neutrino base scale $\mu_0$ from the Leech lattice minimum norm (without post-hoc fitting).

## 5. Strategic Pivot
The immediate focus of the KSAU project is the **publication of v11.0 results** (Weinberg Angle and W/Z splitting), which have been rigorously verified and meet scientific standards. All v12.0 activities are now in "Internal Research" status.
