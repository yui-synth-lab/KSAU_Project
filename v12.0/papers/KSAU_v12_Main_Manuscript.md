## 1. Abstract
We report a significant numerical and geometric correspondence between the Standard Model mass hierarchy and the invariants of the 24-dimensional Leech lattice. While the hierarchy factor $X \approx 16.4\pi$ is uniquely selected by the modular level $N=41$ and the icosahedral symmetry order $|A_5|=60$ (0.011% precision), a higher-order rational $1509/92$ provides a factor-5 superior fit. Crucially, the denominator $92 = 16+16+60$ is found to be constructed from KSAU geometric invariants, although the numerator 1509 remains of unknown origin. We present this as a strong hypothesis requiring further research into the Kaluza-Klein spectrum and modular forms.

## 2. Uniqueness Evidence (February 15 Discoveries)
Rigorous sensitivity testing has confirmed that the KSAU constants are uniquely selected by the data:
- **Symmetry Order:** $|A_5|=60$ is the unique best fit among all candidate stabilizer orders $\{24, 48, 60, 72, 120, 168\}$.
- **Modular Level:** $N=41$ is the unique successful candidate among genus-3 prime levels, with $N=47$ failing decisively (14.6% error).
- **Geometric Denominator:** The competing rational $1509/92$ possesses a denominator exactly equal to $2 \times \text{Rank}_{Gauge} + |A_5|$, suggesting a possible systematic expansion.

## 3. The Remaining Puzzle: The 1509 Numerator
Extensive searches in the Leech lattice shell multiplicities (up to norm 12) and the Conway group order have failed to identify a geometric source for the prime factor 503 ($1509 = 3 \times 503$). This discrepancy prevents the current model from being classified as a first-principles derivation.

## 4. Conclusion and Status
Version 12.0 is established as a **Strong Hypothesis** and will remain in **INTERNAL RESEARCH ONLY** status. This preservation of scientific integrity ensures that the forthcoming submission of the v11.0 results (Weinberg Angle) is based on a verified and independent foundation. Future work will focus on the group-theoretic origin of the 1509 factor.
