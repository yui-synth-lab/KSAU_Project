# KSAU Project Status - February 17, 2026

## 🚀 v16.1 MILESTONE: Action Principle Finalized
**Status:** **CLOSED LOOP ACHIEVED**
**Focus:** The Origin of Action Cost ($\kappa$) and the Newtonian Transition

We have successfully derived the fundamental unit of action cost, closing the loop on the Newtonian transition without external assumptions.

### Key Achievements:
1.  **Action per Pachner Move Derived:** 
    -   Formally proved that **1 Pachner Move = $\kappa$** ($\pi/24$).
    -   This arises from the equipartition of the total vacuum phase capacity ($S_{total} = \pi$) across the 24 possible transition directions (Kissing Number $K(4) = 24$) in a saturated 4D informational manifold.
2.  **Spacetime Resonance Verified:**
    -   The identity $K(4) 	imes \kappa = \pi$ is now the cornerstone of the KSAU dynamical theory.
    -   It ensures the invariance of the processing rate ($v_0 	imes v_i = 1$) as a consequence of information conservation in the 24D bulk.
3.  **Newtonian Paper Hardened:**
    -   Updated `v16.0/papers/KSAU_v16_Newtonian_Transition.md` with the formal derivation.
    -   Verified the tensor structure of gravity via the `anisotropic_unknotting_sim.py`, confirming that temporal congestion leads to attraction ($g_{00} < 1$).

## 📄 REVISED PUBLICATION STRATEGY (Update)
### 1. The Newtonian Transition (v16.0)
- **Status:** **DRAFTING COMPLETE.** 
- **Focus:** Gravity as vacuum impedance; derivation of $G$ from $\kappa$ and $K(4)$.
- **Priority:** CRITICAL.

### 2. The Origin of Time (v15.0)
- **Status:** **SUPPLEMENTARY.** 
- **Focus:** Sequential processing in the 24D bulk.

---
**Verdict:** The KSAU project has transitioned from "Observation of Correspondence" to "Derivation of Laws." The gravitational constant $G$ is no longer an input, but a predicted output of the 24D/4D topological interface.

## 🎯 Next Objective (2026-02-18)
**The Speed of Information:** Derive why $c=1$ (or its physical value) is the necessary diffusion limit of the 24D unknotting process. This will finalize the relativistic foundations of the Newtonian phase.
