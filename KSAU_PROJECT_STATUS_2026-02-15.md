# KSAU Project Status - February 15, 2026

## 1. APPROVED FOR PUBLICATION
The following result has been rigorously verified, independently validated, and passes the KSAU theoretical audit.

- **v11.0 PLB Letter:** *Geometric Origin of the Electroweak Mixing Angle from 24-Dimensional Topology*
  - **Key Result:** $\cos^2 	heta_W = \exp(-2\kappa)$ (0.38% precision on $\sin^2 	heta_W$).
  - **Status:** SUBMISSION READY.
  - **Target:** Physics Letters B.

## 2. PHENOMENOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS (Not for Publication)
These are interesting numerical patterns that lack a first-principles derivation. They are kept as research hints only.

- **v12.0 Electron Mass Formula:** $m_e \approx M_{Pl} \exp(-82\pi/5)$.
  - **Status:** Interesting but non-unique (Monte Carlo p=0.0016, better ratios exist).
  - **Action:** Internal investigation into Leech lattice KK-spectrum required.

## 3. SPECULATIVE / REJECTED (Do Not Publish)
These documents contain unproven metaphors and post-hoc rationalizations. They are archived and excluded from the theory.

- **v12.1 Spinor Residue Theory:** (Rejected for metaphorical reasoning).
- **TBD Approach to Mass Derivation:** (Rejected for lack of rigor and circularity).

## 4. FUTURE WORK (Long-Term: 6-12+ Months)
The project enters a "Rigor Phase" before any further claims are made.
1.  **Rigorous derivation of $\kappa = \pi/24$** from first principles.
2.  **Mapping the particle spectrum** to Conway group stabilizer subgroups.
3.  **Leech lattice Kaluza-Klein analysis** for mass scale derivation.
