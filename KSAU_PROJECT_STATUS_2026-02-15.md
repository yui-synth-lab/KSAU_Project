# KSAU Project Status - February 15, 2026

## APPROVED FOR PUBLICATION
### v11.0: Weinberg Angle Prediction
- **Result:** sin²θ_W = 0.2303 (predicted) vs 0.23122 (observed)
- **Precision:** 0.38% error
- **Verification:** W/Z ratio independently validates κ = π/24
- **Status:** SUBMISSION READY
- **Action:** Submit to Physics Letters B (in progress)
- **Expected timeline:** Acceptance probability 75-85%

## PHENOMENOLOGICAL OBSERVATIONS (Research-level, not mature theory)
### v12.0: Electron Mass Formula
- **Observation:** m_e ≈ M_Pl exp(-82π/5) with 0.58% precision
- **Caveat:** Multiple equivalent ratios exist (1509/92 is more accurate)
- **Status:** Interesting pattern, not uniquely determined
- **Action:** Archive as research note, not for peer-reviewed publication
- **Future:** Investigate Leech lattice Kaluza-Klein spectrum for rigor

## ARCHIVED - NOT FOR PUBLICATION
### v12.1: Spinor Residue Theory [REJECTED]
- **Problems:** Lacks mathematical derivation, uses metaphorical language, circular reasoning, unfalsifiable claims
- **Status:** Archive only, internal reference
- **Action:** Do not discuss publicly

### TBD: Temporal Brownian Dynamics [REJECTED]
- **Problems:** Mixes unrelated concepts, 94.6% fit with 5.4% unexplained, confuses dimensionless with dimensional quantities
- **Status:** Archive only, internal reference
- **Action:** Do not discuss publicly

## FUTURE WORK (6-12+ months)
1. Rigorous derivation of κ = π/24 from 24D vacuum
2. Conway group representation theory mapping
3. Leech lattice Kaluza-Klein analysis
4. Independent prediction tests
5. If successful: Path to v13.0 first-principles theory

## INTEGRITY COMMITMENT
The KSAU project prioritizes scientific honesty over impressive claims. We separate "proven" (v11.0) from "speculative" (v12.0) from "rejected" (v12.1, TBD) explicitly and transparently.
