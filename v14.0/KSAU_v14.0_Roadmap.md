# KSAU v14.0 Roadmap: The Intermediate Scale & Vacuum Action
**Phase:** Full Development / Theoretical Prediction
**Current Status:** v14.0.3 (Physics Audit Applied)
**Date:** February 16, 2026

## 1. Completed Work
- [x] **N=41 Verification:** Confirmed as unique minimum-index level for $g=3$ (N<100).
- [x] **Quartic Law Implementation:** $(g/3)^4$ scaling with monotonicity verified.
- [x] **Code Quality:** All scripts SSoT-compliant, `__file__` paths, error handling.
- [x] **Weinberg Angle:** $\sin^2\theta_W = 1 - e^{-2\kappa}$ (0.38% error, structurally motivated).

## 2. Known Limitations (Acknowledged in Rev 3)
- [x] **511 keV claim retracted:** 0.3 MeV DM cannot produce $e^+e^-$ ($m_{DM} < m_e$).
- [x] **GUT scale discrepancy noted:** $4.64 \times 10^{14}$ GeV is 0.46$\times$ the standard lower bound.
- [x] **Quartic Law circularity documented:** $X$ calibrated from $m_e$; $g=2$ is extrapolation.
- [x] **Gauge coupling coefficients (18, 0.90) marked as phenomenological fits.**
- [x] **IceCube interpretation downgraded:** AGN is standard explanation for PeV events.

## 3. Publication-Ready Claims
- N=41 Minimality Principle (mathematical fact)
- Weinberg angle from $\kappa$ (structurally motivated, sub-1% precision)
- 83 keV WDM prediction (testable by future X-ray missions)

## 4. Internal Research Only
- Gauge coupling table ($\alpha$, $\alpha_s$ formulas)
- DM spectral mapping (pending kinematic fixes)
- GUT scale extrapolation (pending $k=4$ derivation)

## 5. Next Phase: v15.0
- [ ] Derive Quartic exponent $k=4$ from the Laplacian on $X_0(N)$.
- [ ] Address alpha directionality paradox via RG flow.
- [ ] Find viable DM annihilation channels for $m < m_e$ candidates.
