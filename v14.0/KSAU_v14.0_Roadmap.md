# KSAU v14.0 Roadmap: The Intermediate Scale & Vacuum Action
**Phase:** Full Development / Theoretical Prediction
**Current Status:** v14.0.2 (Numerical Integrity Sync)
**Date:** February 16, 2026

## 1. Primary Objective: Predicting the Unknown (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Solve the g=2 Problem:** Predicted $m \approx 4.64 \times 10^{14}$ GeV.
- [x] **Update Scaling Law:** Implemented the **Quartic Law** $(g/3)^4$ for spacetime consistency.
- [x] **Monotonicity Check:** Verified $m(g=1) > m(g=2) > m(g=3)$.

## 2. Phase 1: The "Middle Kingdom" Simulation (COMPLETED)
- [x] Execute `predict_intermediate_scales.py`.
- [x] Align reports with simulation output (Rev 2).

## 3. Phase 2: Formalizing the Action Principle (COMPLETED)
- [x] Verify $N=41$ as the minimum index state for $g=3$.
- [x] Fix LaTeX formatting in all theoretical papers.

## 4. Phase 3: Dark Matter & Gauge Couplings (COMPLETED)
- [x] Unified alpha to $\kappa/18$.
- [x] Implemented __file__ relative paths in all solver scripts.

## 5. Next Phase: v15.0 (Future)
- [ ] **Rigorous derivation of the Quartic exponent ($k=4$) from the modular spectrum.**
- [ ] Address the alpha directionality paradox in RG flow.
