## 1. Abstract
We present the KSAU v14.0 topological dark matter (DM) mass predictions derived from the modular soliton model. Our model, which interprets DM as non-generational "vacuum clots" (solitons), predicts resonance peaks at 2.2 PeV ($N=6$), 83 keV ($N=12$), and 0.3 MeV ($N=24$), plus a trans-Planckian sector ($N=2$). We compare these predictions against current astrophysical data, noting both potential correspondences and significant kinematic and interpretive constraints.

## 2. Predicted Spectrum and Observational Correspondence

### A. The 2.2 PeV Peak ($N=6$, Hexagonal Packing)
- **KSAU Prediction:** $\approx 2.2 \text{ PeV}$.
- **Observational Context:** This energy scale overlaps with IceCube high-energy starting events (HESE). However, the current consensus attributes most PeV-scale neutrino events to **conventional astrophysical sources** (AGN, TDE, starburst galaxies). A DM decay/annihilation origin remains a non-mainstream hypothesis.
- **Status:** Numerical coincidence with an astrophysical energy band. **Not an independent confirmation.**

### B. The 0.3 MeV Peak ($N=24$, Leech Rank)
- **KSAU Prediction:** $\approx 0.3 \text{ MeV}$.
- **⚠️ Kinematic Constraint:** $m_{DM} = 0.3$ MeV $< m_e = 0.511$ MeV. The annihilation channel $DM + DM \to e^+e^-$ is **kinematically forbidden** because the DM mass is below the electron mass threshold. Therefore, this candidate **cannot directly explain the Galactic 511 keV positron annihilation line** via $e^+e^-$ production.
- **Remaining Significance:** The 0.3 MeV peak is a geometric prediction of the modular topology. Its physical role (if any) would require alternative decay channels (e.g., $\gamma\gamma$, neutrino mixing) that do not involve $e^+e^-$ pair production.

### C. The 83 keV Peak ($N=12$, Modular Weight)
- **KSAU Prediction:** $\approx 83 \text{ keV}$.
- **Context:** Falls within the Warm Dark Matter (WDM) window. Currently outside definitive X-ray line constraints (strongest below 40 keV). Serves as a predictive target for next-generation X-ray missions (e.g., ATHENA, Lynx).

### D. The Primordial Sector ($N=2$, Binary Clot)
- **KSAU Prediction:** Trans-Planckian mass ($\sim 10^{78}$ MeV from the soliton formula).
- **Status:** This is a mathematical extrapolation of the soliton model to its extreme limit. The physical interpretation of trans-Planckian objects is speculative and model-dependent.

## 4. Cosmological Constraints and Residual Challenges

While the predicted mass peaks align with astrophysical anomalies, we acknowledge significant constraints from the early universe record:

### A. The 0.3 MeV BBN and Kinematic Challenges
The $N=24$ candidate faces two independent constraints:
1. **Kinematic Threshold (FATAL for 511 keV):** Since $m_{DM} = 0.3$ MeV $< m_e = 0.511$ MeV, the $e^+e^-$ annihilation channel is kinematically closed. The previous claim of alignment with the Galactic 511 keV line is **retracted**.
2. **BBN / $N_{eff}$ Constraint:** Standard BBN and CMB observations strictly constrain thermal dark matter below ~1 MeV. A 0.3 MeV particle in thermal equilibrium would alter the expansion rate during the lepton era.
- **KSAU Hypothesis (Partial):** If these solitons were produced non-thermally (e.g., via a topological phase transition), they could potentially evade $N_{eff}$ bounds. However, the absence of a viable annihilation channel to SM particles makes the observational relevance of this candidate unclear.

### B. Life-time and Decay
The stability of the $N=6$ (PeV) and $N=12$ (keV) sectors must exceed the age of the universe. The non-generational genus ($g < 3$) naturally suppresses standard gauge decays, providing a geometric explanation for their extreme longevity.

## 5. Conclusion
The KSAU soliton model generates a discrete DM mass spectrum from modular topology. However, we must clearly distinguish between **geometric predictions** (the mass values themselves) and **observational claims** (their correspondence to specific astrophysical signals):
- The 511 keV alignment is **retracted** due to kinematic impossibility ($m_{DM} < m_e$).
- The IceCube PeV coincidence is **not an independent confirmation**, as conventional astrophysical sources dominate that energy band.
- The 83 keV WDM candidate remains a **genuinely testable prediction** for future X-ray missions.

The framework's value lies in producing a finite, discrete spectrum from first principles of modular geometry — not in premature observational claims.
