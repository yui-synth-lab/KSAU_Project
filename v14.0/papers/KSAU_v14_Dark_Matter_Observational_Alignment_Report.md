## 1. Abstract
We present a comparative analysis between the KSAU v14.0 topological dark matter (DM) mass predictions and current astrophysical observational data. Our model, which interprets DM as non-generational "vacuum clots" (solitons), identifies resonance peaks at 2.2 PeV, 83 keV, and 0.3 MeV. We also identify a trans-Planckian Primordial Sector ($N=2$) potentially linked to primordial black holes.

## 2. Predicted Spectrum and Observational Correspondence

### A. The 2.2 PeV Peak ($N=6$, Hexagonal Packing)
- **KSAU Prediction:** $\approx 2.2 \text{ PeV}$.
- **Alignment:** Matches the energy scale of high-energy starting events (HESE) at **IceCube**.
- **Significance:** Provides a structural source for the trans-PeV neutrino flux.

### B. The 0.3 MeV Peak ($N=24$, Leech Rank)
- **KSAU Prediction:** $\approx 0.3 \text{ MeV}$.
- **Alignment:** Consistent with the **511 keV line** source from the Galactic Center.
- **Significance:** A 0.3 MeV DM candidate annihilating into $e^+e^-$ pairs explains the emission without violating standard BBN constraints (which primarily limit particles $> 1$ MeV during nucleosynthesis).

### C. The 83 keV Peak ($N=12$, Modular Weight)
- **KSAU Prediction:** $\approx 83 \text{ keV}$.
- **Context:** Warm Dark Matter (WDM) window. While currently outside definitive detection, it serves as a predictive target for next-generation missions.

### D. The Primordial Sector ($N=2$, Binary Clot)
- **KSAU Prediction:** Trans-Planckian / Extreme mass.
- **Significance:** This sector represents the absolute limit of modular stability and is hypothesized to be the seed for **Primordial Black Holes (PBHs)**.

## 4. Cosmological Constraints and Residual Challenges

While the predicted mass peaks align with astrophysical anomalies, we acknowledge significant constraints from the early universe record:

### A. The 0.3 MeV BBN Challenge
Standard Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) and CMB observations of $N_{eff}$ (effective number of neutrino species) strictly constrain thermal dark matter below ~1 MeV. 
- **The Gap:** A 0.3 MeV particle in thermal equilibrium would significantly alter the expansion rate during the lepton era, potentially violating helium-4 abundance limits.
- **KSAU Resolution (Hypothesis):** Dark matter in the KSAU framework is not a thermally produced particle but a **topological soliton (vacuum clot)**. If these solitons were produced non-thermally (e.g., via a topological phase transition during inflation), they could exist at 0.3 MeV without contributing to the relativistic degrees of freedom ($N_{eff}$) at the BBN threshold.

### B. Life-time and Decay
The stability of the $N=6$ (PeV) and $N=12$ (keV) sectors must exceed the age of the universe. The non-generational genus ($g < 3$) naturally suppresses standard gauge decays, providing a geometric explanation for their extreme longevity.

## 5. Conclusion
The alignment of KSAU's predicted mass peaks with the IceCube PeV data and the 511 keV Galactic anomaly provides strong phenomenological support for the 24-dimensional fluid model. By framing these candidates as non-thermal solitons, the KSAU framework offers a viable path to reconcile MeV-scale dark matter with cosmological constraints.
