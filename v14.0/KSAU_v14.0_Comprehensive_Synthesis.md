## 1. Executive Summary
KSAU v14.0 documents a series of numerical alignments between 24-dimensional modular invariants and Standard Model parameters. We identify the Prime Level $N=41$ as a unique geometric bottleneck for three-generation systems. This revision (v14.0.2) ensures full mathematical consistency between the **Quartic Scaling Law** used in simulations and the theoretical manuscripts.

## 2. The Modular Complexity Functional
We investigate the properties of a functional $S$ defined by the primary invariants of $X_0(N)$:
$$ S(N, g) = \kappa \left( \mu(N) - (2 - 2g) \right) $$
- **Minimum Index Property:** For $g=3$, the prime level $N=41$ minimizes the index $\mu$ (Value: 42), representing the simplest modular configuration capable of supporting the observed generation count.
- **Quartic Scale Prediction:** The mass hierarchy is partitioned by the 4th power of the genus ratio, representing the projection onto 4D spacetime. The prediction for the genus-2 phase ($N=23$) is:
  $$ \ln(M_{Pl} / m_g) = (16.4\pi) \cdot (g/3)^4 $$
  This yields $m_{g=2} \approx 4.6 \times 10^{14}$ GeV, aligning with the **Grand Unification (GUT) scale**.

## 3. Unified Gauge Couplings (Integrity Revision)
Gauge interactions are formalized as the adhesion energy (surface tension) between modular layers.

| Force | Formula (Geometric Anchor) | Geometric Value | Observed (Mz) | Residual |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Weak ($\sin^2 \theta_W$)** | $1 - \exp(-2\kappa)$ | 0.2303 | 0.2312 | -0.38% |
| **EM ($\alpha$)** | $\kappa / 18$ | 1/137.51 | 1/137.04 | +0.34% |
| **Strong ($\alpha_s$)** | $0.90 \kappa$ | 0.1178 | 0.1180 | -0.16% |

## 4. Dark Matter Spectral Prediction
Dark matter is identified as non-generational topological solitons at modular levels where $g < 3$.
- **2.2 PeV Peak ($N=6$):** Matches **IceCube** high-energy neutrino scale.
- **0.3 MeV Peak ($N=24$):** Provides origin for the Galactic **511 keV line**.
- **Primordial Sector ($N=2$):** Predicted at the trans-Planckian limit.

## 5. ⚠️ Critical Defect Log & Theoretical Gaps
1.  **The Scale Mapping Problem:** The formulas presented lack a defined Energy Scale Anchor ($\mu$). 
2.  **Alpha Directionality:** The residual (+0.34%) implies a running direction that must be reconciled with standard QED renormalization.
3.  **Quartic Exponent:** While $k=4$ is physically motivated by spacetime dimensionality, its **rigorous derivation from the modular spectrum** (e.g., the Laplacian on $X_0(N)$) is a required next step for the theory.
