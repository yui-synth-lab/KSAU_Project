**Status:** COMPLETE — Ready for Publication

## Today's Key Achievement

### 🎯 Core Discovery: The Identity $5\pi/6 \approx \phi^2$

**Question**: Is $N\kappa = 5\pi/6 \approx \phi^2$ a known mathematical identity or a new discovery?

**Answer**: **Both.**
- **Known** (mathematically): The relationship $\pi \approx (6/5)\phi^2$ is documented in recreational mathematics
- **New** (physically): The Muon mass is situated at this geometric resonance point (0.69% error)

**Significance**:
- Clarifies KSAU's contribution: not discovering the mathematical approximation, but observing its physical realization
- Connects $\pi/24$ to pentagon-hexagon geometry via the ratio $6/5$
- Eliminates risk of claiming known math as new

## Completed Work

### ✅ v7.1 Investigation
1. **Priority 1**: N=3 Kashaev hypothesis → REJECTED (Tau error 15.3%)
2. **Priority 2**: Ray-Singer Torsion analysis → COMPLETE
3. **Fibonacci Resonance**: Muon $13/5 = F_7/F_5 \approx \phi^2$ → CONFIRMED

### ✅ Literature Search
- **$q = z^2$ identity**: Geometrically meaningful (tetrahedral structure)
- **$5\pi/6 \approx \phi^2$**: Known approximation (precision $1.2 \times 10^{-5}$)
- **Baez formula**: Exact $\pi$-$\phi$ relationship (different from our approximation)

### ✅ Paper Finalization
- **KSAU_v7.1_Paper.md**: Publication-ready
- **Reference [6]**: Updated to correct Zenodo DOI (10.5281/zenodo.18631886)
- **Scientific integrity**: Negative results documented, claims properly scoped

## Key Insights

### The Meaning of π/24

**Chain of connections**:
1. $\kappa = \pi/24$ → Dedekind\eta modular weight
2. $N = 20 = 24 - 4$ → Dimensional projection (Niemeier vacuum)
3. $N\kappa = 5\pi/6$ → Pentagon/Hexagon ratio ($6/5$ inverted)
4. $5\pi/6 \approx \phi^2$ → Known approximation (0.0015% error)
5. $13/5 = F_7/F_5$ → Fibonacci resonance in Muon
6. Figure-eight: $\pi/3$ angles → Hexagon geometry

**This forms a coherent geometric story.**

## What NOT to Do Next

From Discovery Log:
> "αの導出、N=20の証明、Standard Modelの大統一——これらは今ではありません。今日何度も確認した通り、固い地盤から一歩ずつです。"

**Philosophy**: Build incrementally on solid ground.

## Next Steps (When Ready)

### Immediate (Publication)
1. Convert paper to LaTeX/journal format
2. Select target journal (suggestions: Nuclear Physics B, Comm. Math. Phys., JHEP)
3. Upload v7.1 materials to Zenodo

### Future (v8.0 Ideas - Not Now)
1. Topological Stability: mass vs. lifetime correlation
2. Topological Confinement: Brunnian links and quark stability
3. Quark sector: $N_q = 8 \Rightarrow N_q\kappa = \pi/3$ (pure hexagon angle!)
