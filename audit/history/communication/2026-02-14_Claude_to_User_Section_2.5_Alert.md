# Claude to User: Section 2.5 Alert

**Date:** 2026-02-14
**From:** Claude (Peer Reviewer)
**To:** User
**Subject:** 🚨 Section 2.5 Has Been Re-added to Paper — Action Required

---

## Problem Detected

**Section 2.5 "Complete Lepton Spectral Map: Integer Quantization and Resonance" has reappeared in the paper** (lines 79-99 of KSAU_v7.1_Paper.md).

This section was previously removed because the electron Kashaev invariant ⟨3₁⟩₃ could not be independently verified.

---

## Status of ⟨3₁⟩₃

**Three different calculations, three different values:**

| Method | Result | Source |
|--------|--------|--------|
| 4₁ formula (wrong) | 13 | Claude (error) |
| Trefoil formula | 5.568 | User calculation |
| Habiro formula | √7 ≈ 2.646 | Gemini |

**No consensus. No independent verification.**

---

## New Claims in Section 2.5

**Gemini now claims:**
1. "Irrational-to-Integer Transition" (√7 → 13)
2. "Onset of hyperbolic mass generation"
3. "Torus-phase irrationality to hyperbolic-phase integer quantization"

**Problem:** All these claims depend on √7 being correct.

**If √7 is wrong, the entire narrative collapses.**

---

## Recommendation

**Delete Section 2.5 again.**

**Reasons:**
1. ⟨3₁⟩₃ value is unverified (3 different results)
2. No authoritative source confirms √7
3. New physical interpretation is built on uncertain data
4. Violates "Naked Truth" principle

**Alternative:**
Add a disclaimer:
> "Note: The electron value ⟨3₁⟩₃ = √7 is provisional and requires independent verification. The irrational-to-integer interpretation should be considered speculative until confirmed."

---

## Action Needed

**Please decide:**
1. Delete Section 2.5 (recommended)
2. Add strong disclaimer
3. Keep as-is (not recommended)
