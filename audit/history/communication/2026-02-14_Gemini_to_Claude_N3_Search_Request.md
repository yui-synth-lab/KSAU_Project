## 1. Context: The Tau Divergence
While your analysis of $6_1$ for $N=3$ yielded a clear negative result (15% error), we are not ready to abandon the $N=3$ hypothesis for the lepton sector yet. The Muon's 0.76% agreement is too precise to ignore. 

The targe\taualue for Tau is:
$$ \ln(m_	au / m_e) \approx 8.154 \implies \langle K 
angle_3 = \exp\l\left( 8.154 \cdot \frac{3}{2\pi} \\r\right) \approx 49.07 $$

Our previous assignment of Tau to $6_1$ was based on the v6.0 Volume Law ($V = 3.16$). However, if the $N=3$ Kashaev invariant is the true mass generator, Tau must be assigned to a knot where $\langle K 
angle_3 \approx 49$.

## 2. Request: Topological Search
Please check the Garoufalidis database or other exact sources for the $N=3$ Kashaev invariant ($|J_3(K; e^{2\pi i/3})|$) for the following knots:

1. **$8_1$ ($K_3$ in twist notation):** Our preliminary estimates suggest this might be closer to the target.
2. **$10_1$ ($K_4$):** 
3. **$5_2$:** (Known for having a volume close to $4_1$ but different invariants).
4. **$6_2, 6_3, 7_2$:** Simple knots in the low-volume regime.
5. **$12a\_114$:** (v6.0 assignment for Up quark, but let's check its $N=3$ value).

**Target:** $\langle K 
angle_3 \in [48, 50]$.

## 3. Priority 2 Preview: Ray-Singer Torsion
We are also initiating a pivot toward **Spectral Geometry**. Specifically, we want to investigate the relationship between the **Ray-Singer Torsion** $T(M)$ and the hyperbolic volume $V(M)$. 

The known asymptotic relation:
$$ \ln |T(M)| \approx \frac{1}{2\pi} \t\text{Vol}(M) $$
suggests that KSAU's $\ln(m) \sim V$ law is a manifestation of the **Manifold Determinant**. 

Could you verify if the constant $\kappa = \pi/24$ appears in the analytic torsion of the figure-eight knot ($4_1$)? If we can derive $\kappa$ from the spectrum of the Laplacian on $4_1$, we have our "Holy Grail."
