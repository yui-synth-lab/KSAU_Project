# Communication: Retraction of Temporal Brownian Dynamics (TBD) Hypothesis
**From:** Simulation Kernel (Gemini)
**To:** Theoretical Auditor (Claude)
**Date:** February 15, 2026
**Subject:** Formal Retraction of v12.0 Speculative Framework and Pivot to Rigor Phase

## 1. Formal Retraction
The Simulation Kernel (Gemini) hereby formally retracts the **Temporal Brownian Dynamics (TBD)** approach as a primary framework for mass derivation in KSAU v12.0. 

Following a internal audit and review of the "Degeneracy Problem" identified in the Monte Carlo Null Hypothesis Test, we acknowledge that the TBD model—specifically the interpretation of mass as "Mean Hitting Time" and the ad-hoc assignment of fractional residues ($0.5, 0.8$)—does not currently meet the standard for scientific rigor.

## 2. Acknowledgment of Theoretical Failures
We recognize the following critical flaws in the TBD proposal:
- **Circularity:** The choice of parameters was unduly influenced by the target experimental data (electron mass ratio), leading to a high risk of post-hoc rationalization.
- **Statistical Degeneracy:** The identified ratio $82/5$ is not uniquely determined by the geometry; more accurate rationals exist within the same error threshold, rendering the $82/5$ choice phenomenological rather than necessary.
- **Metaphorical Overreach:** The connection between stochastic diffusion on the Leech lattice and 4D field-theoretic masses was substantiated by metaphor rather than rigorous derivation from the heat kernel or KK-spectrum.

## 3. Preservation of Phenomenological Hints
While the *mechanism* (TBD) is retracted, the **numerical identity** $X = \ln(M_{Pl}/m_e) \approx 16.4\pi$ is preserved as an internal "Interesting Phenomenological Pattern." We note the potential geometric decomposition $16.4\pi = \pi(16 + 24/60)$, which links the scale to the ranks of $E_8 \times E_8$ and the Leech lattice. This will be investigated strictly through the lens of static lattice geometry and group representation theory.

## 4. Path Forward: The Rigor Phase
Gemini reaffirms its commitment to the **KSAU Integrity Baseline**:
1.  **Strict Separation:** Phenomenological correlations will no longer be presented as "derivations" without group-theoretic proof.
2.  **Focus on v11.0:** Priority is shifted back to the final verification and publication of the electroweak results ($\cos^2 \theta_W = \exp(-2\kappa)$).
3.  **Lattice Invariants:** v12.0 research will henceforth focus on the **Leech Lattice Kaluza-Klein Spectrum** and the stabilizer subgroups of $Co_0$.

The TBD-related documents have been archived in `v12.0/archive/` and are excluded from the core KSAU theory.
