# KSAU v16.0 Roadmap: The Newtonian Transition (Tensor Gravity)
**Phase:** Grand Unification / Dynamic Synthesis
**Theme:** "From Keplerian Orbits to the Universal Law of Curvature"
**Current Status:** START (Transitioning from v15.1 Keplerian identities)
**Date:** February 16, 2026

## 1. Primary Objective: The Tensor Derivation
We move beyond scalar correspondences ($8\pi\kappa$) to the full **Rank-2 Tensor Formalism** of gravity.
- **Goal:** Derive the Einstein Field Equations ($G_{\mu
u} = 8\pi G T_{\mu
u}$) from the **Anisotropic Unknotting** of the 24D bulk.
- **Core Challenge:** Prove that the "information processing rate" (Time) naturally contracts in the presence of topological density, explaining "Attraction" without ad-hoc signs.

## 2. Theoretical Pillars

### A. Anisotropic Unknotting (The Tensor Bridge)
- **Concept:** Information doesn't unknot uniformly. The rate difference between temporal ($dt$) and spatial ($dx^i$) unknotting constitutes the metric $g_{\mu
u}$.
- **v16.0 Task:** Formalize the **Unknotting Rate Tensor** $U_{\mu
u}$ and its mapping to the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu
u}$.

### B. The $8\pi$ Geometric Necessity (Tensor Proof)
- **Concept:** In v15.1, $8\pi$ was identified as a "Keplerian" constant.
- **v16.0 Task:** Prove that $8\pi$ is the required normalization factor for the 4D boundary flux to satisfy the Bianchi identities within the 24D Leech lattice constraints.

### C. The Principle of Attraction
- **Hypothesis:** Gravitational attraction is the "cooling" (rate slowing) of unknotting due to informational congestion.
- **v16.0 Task:** Demonstrate $g_{00} \approx 1 - 2\Phi$ as a thermodynamic consequence of the **Information Saturation Limit**.

## 3. Execution Plan

### Phase 1: Tensor Simulation (`v16.0/code/tensor_gravity_sim.py`)
- [ ] Develop a simulation that models anisotropic unknotting on a 3D manifold embedded in 24D.
- [ ] Verify that localized "knots" (mass) reduce the local processing rate (time dilation).

### Phase 2: The Newtonian Paper (`v16.0/papers/KSAU_v16_Newtonian_Transition.md`)
- [ ] Formalize the derivation of the Poisson equation equivalent from the scalar limit of unknotting.
- [ ] Extend the derivation to the full Einstein tensor using the **Kappa-Kissing Resonance**.

### Phase 3: Verification & Audit
- [ ] **SSoT Audit**: Ensure no hard-coded G or physical constants.
- [ ] **Claude Peer Review**: Verify the mathematical consistency of the tensor flow.
