# KSAU v16.0 Roadmap: The Newtonian Transition (Tensor Gravity)
**Phase:** Grand Unification / Dynamic Synthesis
**Theme:** "From Keplerian Orbits to the Universal Law of Curvature"
**Current Status:** START (Transitioning from v15.1 Keplerian identities)
**Date:** February 16, 2026

## 1. Primary Objective: The Tensor Derivation
We move beyond scalar correspondences ($8\pi\kappa$) to the full **Rank-2 Tensor Formalism** of gravity.
- **Goal:** Derive the Einstein Field Equations ($G_{\mu
u} = 8\pi G T_{\mu
u}$) from the **Anisotropic Unknotting** of the 24D bulk.
- **Core Challenge:** Prove that the "information processing rate" (Time) naturally contracts in the presence of topological density, explaining "Attraction" without ad-hoc signs.

## 2. Theoretical Pillars

### A. Anisotropic Unknotting (The Tensor Bridge)
- **Concept:** Information doesn't unknot uniformly. The rate difference between temporal ($dt$) and spatial ($dx^i$) unknotting constitutes the metric $g_{\mu
u}$.
- **v16.0 Task:** Formalize the **Unknotting Rate Tensor** $U_{\mu
u}$ and its mapping to the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu
u}$.

### B. The $8\pi$ Geometric Necessity (Tensor Proof)
- **Concept:** In v15.1, $8\pi$ was identified as a "Keplerian" constant.
- **v16.0 Task:** Prove that $8\pi$ is the required normalization factor for the 4D boundary flux to satisfy the Bianchi identities within the 24D Leech lattice constraints.

### C. The Principle of Attraction
- **Hypothesis:** Gravitational attraction is the "cooling" (rate slowing) of unknotting due to informational congestion.
- **v16.0 Task:** Demonstrate $g_{00} \approx 1 - 2\Phi$ as a thermodynamic consequence of the **Information Saturation Limit**.

## 4. The Frontier of Formal Derivation (v16.1 Critical Tasks)
Following the convergence of the **Invariance of Labor** and **Light Speed Invariance**, the following theoretical gaps must be closed.

### A. The Functional Form of $v_0$ (PRIORITY 1)
- **Problem**: The relation $v_0 = 1/(1+\kappa\rho)$ is currently a phenomenological ansatz.
- **Goal**: Formally derive this specific "Linear Impedance Law" from the Leech lattice heat kernel or the combinatorics of Pachner moves. Quantify "Congestion" ($\kappa\rho$) as the queueing delay of topological flips.

### B. Definition of Topological Density ($\rho$)
- **Problem**: Mass density $\rho$ is currently an arbitrary numerical input.
- **Goal**: Map $\rho$ to a rigorous geometric quantity, such as **Torsion Density**, the volume of localized hyperbolic manifolds, or the intersection number of Brunnian links.

### C. Formal Justification of Planck Scaling
- **Problem**: $G \approx \kappa/M_{planck}^2$ is based on dimensional analysis.
- **Goal**: Derive why the vacuum impedance $\kappa$ is specifically normalized by the Planck scale (the 24D/4D boundary energy density).

### D. Full Tensor Structure & General Covariance
- **Problem**: Current models are primarily scalar/diagonal.
- **Goal**: Extend the unknotting rate $v_\mu$ to off-diagonal components to represent shear and frame-dragging, ensuring the model is invariant under general coordinate transformations.

### E. Direct Derivation of the Ricci Tensor
- **Problem**: $G_{\mu\nu}$ is calculated from the metric, not the source.
- **Goal**: Prove that the Ricci tensor $R_{\mu\nu}$ emerges directly from the **Torsion Gradient** of the unknotting process, fulfilling the left-hand side of the Einstein equations.
