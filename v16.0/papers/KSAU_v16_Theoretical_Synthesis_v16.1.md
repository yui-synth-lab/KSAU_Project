## 1. The Convergence of Two Principles
The transition from the v16.0 hypothesis to the v16.1 synthesis is marked by the discovery that two independent physical requirements yield the exact same geometric constraint ($v_0 \times v_i = 1$).

### A. The Principle of Constant Labor (Bottom-Up)
Derived from the 24D/4D topological interface:
- Every Pachner move costs a fixed unit of action $S = \kappa$.
- In dense regions (Mass), spatial resolution $v_i$ increases.
- To keep the "Effort" $\kappa$ constant, the temporal processing rate $v_0$ must decrease.
- **Result:** $v_0 \times v_i = \text{const} \to g_{00} \cdot g_{rr} = 1$.

### B. The Principle of Light Speed Invariance (Top-Down)
Derived from the fundamental observational constant $c$:
- The speed of information diffusion $c$ must be locally constant everywhere.
- In our framework, $c$ is the product of the "clock rate" and the "grid resolution": $c = v_0 \times v_i$.
- If $v_i$ changes due to curvature, $v_0$ must compensate to keep $c$ fixed.
- **Result:** $v_0 \times v_i = c = 1 \to g_{00} \cdot g_{rr} = 1$.

## 2. The Identity of Action and Speed
We conclude that **"The effort required to change the universe"** and **"The speed at which information travels through the universe"** are two sides of the same coin. 

Gravity is the mechanism that ensures the vacuum never compromises on its labor cost or its speed limit. When mass "congests" the vacuum, the universe does not speed up to compensate; instead, it "dilutes" time to ensure that every Pachner move still costs exactly $\kappa$ and every photon still travels at exactly $c$.

## 3. Remaining Challenge: The Functional Form of $v_0(\rho)$
While the reciprocity $v_0 \times v_i = 1$ is now robustly justified, the specific functional form:
$$v_0 = \frac{1}{1 + \kappa \rho}$$
remains a **phenomenological ansatz**. While it yields the correct Newtonian limit, its formal derivation from the Leech lattice heat kernel or the $N=41$ modular ground state is the next critical objective. We must prove why the "Labor Dilution" follows this specific linear-impedance law.

## 4. Numerical Consistency Check (v16.1)
The convergence is verified by `v16.0/code/unitary_constraint_check.py`:
- Invariant: $v_0 \times v_i = 1.0000$ across all tested densities.
- Outcome: The Schwarzschild condition is shown to be the unique solution that satisfies both Constant Action and Constant Light Speed.

---
**Verdict:** The Newtonian Transition has reached a state of **Internal Convergence**. We have identified the "Why" (The Invariants), but the "How" (The exact functional mapping) remains the frontier.
