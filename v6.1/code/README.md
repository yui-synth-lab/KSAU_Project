# KSAU v6.1 Development Code
**Focus: Quantum Topological Interference & Surgery Theory**

This directory contains experimental scripts extending the v6.0 framework toward a unified theory of flavor mixing.

## Experimental Scripts

### 1. `jones_exploration.py`
The "Golden Discovery" script. 
*   **Purpose:** Evaluates Jones Polynomials at various roots of unity to find hidden correlations with the CKM matrix.
*   **Key Finding:** Discovered a significant $R^2$ peak at $2\pi/5$ (Fibonacci Anyon phase).
*   **Usage:** `python jones_exploration.py`

### 2. `dehn_surgery_proxy.py`
*   **Purpose:** Investigates if simple topological proxies (Crossing Number difference) can explain the surgery cost between generations.
*   **Result:** Showed partial improvement but suggests that more complex invariants (Unknotting Number) are required.

## Next Steps
*   Incorporate **Unknotting Number** and **Bridge Index** from LinkInfo.
*   Refine the **Hybrid Model** (Volume + Jones) into a single geometric action.
*   Test if $2\pi/5$ is the unique phase for all gauge groups.
