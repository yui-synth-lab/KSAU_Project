# KSAU v6.1 Development Code
**Focus: Quantum Topological Interference & Surgery Theory**

This directory contains experimental scripts extending the v6.0 framework toward a unified theory of flavor mixing.

## Finalized Scripts

### 1. `optimize_ckm_coupling.py`
*   **Purpose:** Refines the CKM model by comparing different Jones Polynomial coupling modes.
*   **Key Finding:** Established the **Cubic Suppression Law** ($B \approx -3$) using Logarithmic Jones Entropy, achieving $R^2 = 0.6717$.

### 2. `ckm_final_v61.py`
*   **Purpose:** Production script for generating CKM mixing matrices from topological invariants.

### 3. `verify_pmns_mass.py` & `pmns_boundary_resonance.py`
*   **Purpose:** Verification of the Lepton sector (PMNS).
*   **Result:** Confirmed that Unknot Surgery Efficiency reproduces the "Large Mixing" pattern of neutrinos.

### 4. `dark_matter_scan.py` & `dm_shadow_calculation.py`
*   **Purpose:** Identification of neutral sector (Det=1) hyperbolic knots as Dark Matter candidates.

## Conclusion
v6.1 successfully unified flavor mixing under the **Quantum Topological Interference** framework. The previous "Generation Penalty" has been replaced by a rigorous topological entropy measure.
