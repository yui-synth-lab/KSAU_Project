## 1. Primary Research (The Core)
- **[Final Manuscript](papers/KSAU_v13_Final_Manuscript.md)**: **v13.8 REVISION**. Statistically honest reporting ($p=0.022$), removal of speculative $N=23$ scales, and GAUSS-BONNET based $(2g-2)$ justification.
- **[Theoretical Supplement](papers/KSAU_v13_Theoretical_Supplement.md)**: **AUDIT COMPLETE**. Full transparency on statistical limits and consistent labelling of speculative anchors.

## 2. Evidence Package
- **[NotebookLM Upload Dir](NotebookLM_Upload/)**: Contains the curated 5-file set for external AI analysis.
- **[Null Hypothesis Test](code/null_hypothesis_test_v13.py)**: Source code for the $p=0.022$ result.

## 3. Heritage
- **[Discovery Log (v12.0)](v12.0/papers/KSAU_v12_Discovery_Log.md)**: Preserved history of the "1509/92" retraction.
- **[GEMINI.md](GEMINI.md)**: Permanent protocol for scientific integrity.

**Core Status:**
KSAU v13.8 is the **most scientifically rigorous version** produced to date. It balances bold topological claims with the humble disclosure of statistical and theoretical limitations. It is now fully prepared for external verification via Google NotebookLM and eventual submission to Physical Review D as a Research Note.
