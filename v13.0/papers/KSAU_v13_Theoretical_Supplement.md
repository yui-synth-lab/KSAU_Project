## S1. Statistical Limits (The p-value Reality)
The null hypothesis test ($p = 0.0217$) is presented as an **indicative result** only.

### Caveats:
1. **Search Range:** Primes $N < 200$ were chosen arbitrarily to facilitate computation.
2. **Post-hoc Tuning:** The inclusion of the $(2g-2)$ term was motivated by the residual observed in the $N=41$ Standard Planck Mass fit.
3. **Significance:** In particle physics, $p \approx 0.02$ is considered "barely indicative." It justifies further research but does not constitute proof of discovery.

## S2. Logical Derivation of Curvature (2g-2)
To address concerns of "backward fitting," we emphasize the logical priority of the $g=1$ case:
1. **Flat Case (g=1):** The simplest modular curve $X_0(11)$ predicts $X \approx 23.04$ without any curvature correction.
2. **Generalization:** Extending the formula to $g>1$ naturally requires accounting for the surface curvature. The degree of the canonical divisor $2g-2$ is the most fundamental integer invariant of a Riemann surface that measures this curvature.
3. **Consistency:** The fact that the same invariant that is zero for $g=1$ provides the correct shift for $g=3$ is a structural hint of the theory's internal consistency.
