# KSAU v14.0+ Future Research Roadmap: Beyond the Phenomenological Hint

**Date:** February 15, 2026
**Status:** STRATEGIC PLANNING
**Origin:** Recommendations from PEER-REV-017 (Claude)

## 1. Mid-Term Objectives (Level 2: Strengthening the Core)

### 2-A. Independent Derivation via Selberg Trace Formula
The current $(2g-2)$ curvature correction, while geometrically motivated, must be derived directly from the spectral theory of $X_0(N)$.
- **Task:** Calculate the contribution of the $
u_2=2$ elliptic points to the Laplacian spectrum using the Selberg Trace Formula.
- **Goal:** Prove that the term $\mathcal{R}(2g-2)$ emerges as a rigorous eigenvalue shift, moving the paper from a "Research Note" back to a "Physical Review Letter" (PRL) caliber.

## 2. Long-Term Vision (Level 3: Grand Unification)

### 3-A. Unified Theory of 3D Knots and 2D Curves
Reconcile the two pillars of KSAU:
- **Pillar 1 (v6.0):** Fermion masses from 3D hyperbolic knot volumes.
- **Pillar 2 (v13.0):** Planck scales from 2D modular curve topology.
- **Link:** Investigate why $\kappa = \pi/24$ is invariant across these dimensions. Explore the link via **Ray-Singer Torsion** as a bridge between 3-manifold topology and 2-manifold spectral data.

### 3-B. Prediction of the g=2 Intermediate Scale
The $g=2$ anchor ($N=23$, Action $\approx 35.13$) currently lacks a definitive Standard Model counterpart.
- **Hypothesis:** This scale relates to heavy sterile neutrinos, the inflaton field, or the BSM (Beyond Standard Model) threshold.
- **Goal:** Transform the theory from a "fit" to a "prediction" by identifying specific observational signatures at the $10^{15}$ GeV scale.

## 3. Immediate Next Steps for v14.0 Initial Phase
1. **Automated Selberg Integration:** Develop a numeric solver for the orbifold Selberg trace on $X_0(41)$.
2. **Global Integration Audit:** Cross-verify the mass laws of v6.0 with the topology ratio $\mathcal{R}$ of v13.9.
