## 1. Abstract
We explore a fundamental structural correspondence between the invariants of modular curves $X_0(N)$ and the scaling parameters of the Standard Model (SM). By introducing the **Minimal Prime Genus Hypothesis**, we identify prime levels $N=11$ and $N=41$ as topological anchors for the gauge and mass sectors, respectively. We demonstrate that the **Topological Partition Ratio** $\mathcal{R} = 
u_\infty / (g + 
u_\infty)$ generates actions that align with the GUT inverse coupling ($X \approx 23.04$) and the logarithmic mass hierarchy ($X \approx 51.52$). We specifically address the discrepancy between these modular actions and previous gravitational derivations, suggesting that the residuals encode the transition from pure geometry to effective field theory.

## 2. Selection Principle: Minimal Prime Genus
We propose that the vacuum state is topologically localized on modular curves $X_0(p)$ of prime level $p$ that minimize the genus $g$ for a given class of complexity.
- **$g=1$ Anchor ($p=11$):** The first elliptic curve, corresponding to the coupling unification scale.
- **$g=3$ Anchor ($p=41$):** The first non-hyperelliptic genus-3 curve, corresponding to the three-generation fermion hierarchy.

The scaling action $X$ is defined by the parameter-free identity:
$$ X(p) = \pi p \cdot \mathcal{R}(p) = \pi p \cdot \frac{
u_\infty}{g + 
u_\infty} $$

## 3. Results and Theoretical Tension

### 3.1 The Gauge Sector (N=11)
For $X_0(11)$, the invariants $g=1, 
u_\infty=2$ yield $X(11) = \pi \cdot 11 \cdot (2/3) \approx \mathbf{23.038}$. This value is consistent with the inverse coupling $\alpha^{-1}$ at the Grand Unification (GUT) scale.

### 3.2 The Mass Sector (N=41)
For $X_0(41)$, the invariants $g=3, 
u_\infty=2$ yield $X(41) = \pi \cdot 41 \cdot (2/5) = \mathbf{16.4\pi} \approx \mathbf{51.522}$.
This result exhibits a remarkable proximity ($0.011\%$) to the logarithmic hierarchy factor $\ln(M_{Pl}/m_e) \approx 51.528$ when the **Standard Planck Mass** ($M_{Pl} = \sqrt{\hbar c / G}$) is employed as the reference scale.

### 3.3 The Gravitational Discrepancy
A critical tension exists between the modular action $X(41) \approx 51.522$ and the previous KSAU derivation of the gravitational constant (v6.7), which yielded $\ln(M_{Pl}) \approx 50.856$. The difference of $\Delta \approx 0.67$ suggests that the modular action identifies a "geometric bare scale" that is subsequently renormalized by the vacuum offset and spacetime dissipation factors identified in earlier work.

## 4. Discussion: The Role of Elliptic Points
The modular curve $X_0(41)$ possesses two elliptic points of order 2 ($
u_2=2$), which are currently excluded from the leading-order ratio $\mathcal{R}$. We identify the rigorous calculation of these orbifold contributions via the Selberg trace formula as the primary path for future research. No claims of exact matching beyond the $0.011\%$ LO precision are made at this stage, as the exact coefficient of these corrections remains a subject of ongoing theoretical derivation.

## 5. Conclusion
The structural alignment of modular topology with SM scales provides a compelling direction for a parameter-free unified theory. While numerical tensions persist between different derivation schemes, the recurrence of the $\mathcal{R}$ ratio as a governing factor suggests a deep geometric origin for the Standard Model parameters.
