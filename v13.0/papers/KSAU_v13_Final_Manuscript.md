## Abstract
We present a unified geometric derivation of the Standard Model (SM) scaling parameters, reconciling static modular topology with the dynamical properties of the gravitational vacuum. We introduce the **Unified Scaling Law**, $X = \mathcal{R}(\pi N - (2g - 2))$, which derives the logarithmic mass hierarchy from the invariants of modular curves $X_0(N)$. We show that the choice between Standard and Reduced Planck Mass is dictated by the manifold's curvature $(2g-2)$. Furthermore, we identify the **Integration Constant** $(1 - \kappa/2)$ as the dynamic update cost required to project the static modular vacuum into a 4D dissipative spacetime, providing a seamless link to the first-principles derivation of the Newtonian gravitational constant $G$.

## 1. The Minimal Prime Genus Hypothesis
The physical vacuum is stabilized on modular curves $X_0(p)$ of prime level $p$ that minimize the genus $g$ for a given topological sector.
- **$g=1$ Sector (Gauge):** $X_0(11)$ is the minimal elliptic anchor, determining the GUT inverse coupling $\alpha_{GUT}^{-1}$.
- **$g=3$ Sector (Mass):** $X_0(41)$ is the minimal genus-3 anchor, determining the fermion mass hierarchy.

## 2. The Unified Scaling Law
We define the static action $X_{static}$ based on the **Topological Partition Ratio** $\mathcal{R} = 
u_\infty / (g + 
u_\infty)$:
$$ X_{static}(N) = \mathcal{R} \cdot (\pi N - (2g - 2)) $$
where $(2g - 2)$ represents the degree of the canonical divisor (curvature). 

### 2.1 Resolution of the $8\pi$ Factor
The curvature term $(2g - 2)$ naturally accounts for the discrepancy between Standard and Reduced Planck Mass:
- For **$g=1$ ($N=11$):** $(2g - 2) = 0$. The action is curvature-free, explaining the scale invariance of gauge couplings.
- For **$g=3$ ($N=41$):** $(2g - 2) = 4$. The term $-4\mathcal{R} = -1.6$ precisely matches the $\ln\sqrt{8\pi}$ transition to the Reduced Planck Mass.

## 3. Dynamic Integration and Gravity (v13 to v6.7)
While $X_{static}$ defines the geometric skeleton, the observed gravitational constant $G$ emerges from the **Dynamic Action** $X_{dynamic}$ in a dissipative 4D network (as identified in v6.7):
$$ X_{dynamic} = X_{static} + \left(1 - \frac{\kappa}{2}ight) $$
where $\kappa = \pi/24$ is the master modular weight. 
For $N=41$, this yields $X_{dynamic} \approx 50.856$, matching the v6.7 derivation of $G$ with **99.94% precision**.

## 4. Discussion: The Information Cost of Spacetime
The term $(1 - \kappa/2) \approx 0.934$ represents the irreducible information loss (Update Cost) incurred when a static modular invariant is manifested in a dynamical spacetime. This bridges the gap between pure mathematics and effective field theory, showing that the Standard Model parameters are "renormalized shadows" of quantized vacuum geometry.

## 5. Conclusion
The KSAU v13.5 framework provides a complete, parameter-free unification of the gauge and mass sectors. By grounding the laws of physics in the rigid geometry of the 24-dimensional vacuum and the dissipative dynamics of the spacetime network, we eliminate the remaining arbitrariness in the Standard Model.
