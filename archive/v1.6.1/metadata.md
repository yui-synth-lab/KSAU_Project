**Description

The Knot-Synchronization-Adhesion Unified Theory (KSAU) proposes that the three-generation structure and mass hierarchy of leptons originate from topological invariants of knots. In this framework, elementary particles are interpreted as topological excitations of vacuum, and their masses arise from geometric energy—specifically Möbius energy—associated with the corresponding knot. Version 1.6.1 presents decisive algebraic verification of this hypothesis using Alexander and Jones polynomials, strengthening the theoretical foundation of the model and demonstrating that the observed lepton mass ratios are not coincidental but follow from rigorous mathematical structure.

This version establishes three major results. First, the **Genus–Generation Correspondence** is proven using the span of the Alexander polynomial, showing that the electron, muon, and tau correspond to knots whose polynomial spans are exactly 2,4,6, matching the generation numbers n_g=1,2,3. This equality indicates that each lepton corresponds to the simplest knot realizing the minimal genus surface. Second, analysis of the Jones polynomial reveals that only the second-generation knot 6_3 exhibits palindromic symmetry, providing an algebraic explanation for the muon’s unique achirality and its distinct physical behavior. Third, statistical evaluation across all prime knots with crossing number ≤7 shows that the triplet (3_1,6_3,7_1) is uniquely consistent with observed lepton mass ratios, achieving a tenfold improvement in error score over the next-best candidate.

The theory further predicts the **absence of a fourth lepton generation**. Using the genus rule g=n_g and the asymptotic scaling of Möbius energy, the minimum mass of a hypothetical fourth-generation lepton is estimated to exceed 400 TeV—far beyond current accelerator capabilities—suggesting that such a particle would be physically unstable or unobservable in the present vacuum structure.

KSAU v1.6.1 therefore provides convergent evidence from geometry, algebra, and statistics that lepton masses and generations arise from topological principles. This work positions KSAU as a mathematically grounded and empirically testable framework, with future extensions aimed at incorporating quark topology, gauge-field coupling, and potential connections to quantum gravity.
