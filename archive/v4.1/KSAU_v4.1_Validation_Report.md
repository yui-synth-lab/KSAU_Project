# [DEPRECATED] KSAU v4.1 Validation Report: Complex Volume & CS Correction

**Date:** February 6, 2026
**Status:** **REJECTED / SUPERSEDED**
**Superseded By:** `KSAU_v4.1_Final_Proposal.md`
**Critique:** See `KSAU_v4.1_Critique_Response.md`

## ⚠️ WARNING: METHODOLOGICAL FLAWS DETECTED ⚠️

**This report describes an initial experimental approach ("Phase 3 Unified Correction") that has been rejected due to the following critical issues:**

1.  **Fake Lepton Data:** The use of Chern-Simons invariants for non-hyperbolic torus knots ($3_1, 7_1$) is mathematically invalid.
2.  **Poor Performance:** This model worsened the Top quark error (+16.4%) and failed to resolve the Muon anomaly (+14.2%).
3.  **Statistical Validity:** The global application of the CS term lacks sufficient statistical justification compared to the baseline.

**Please refer to `KSAU_v4.1_Final_Proposal.md` for the definitive v4.1 results (Global MAE 3.03%), which utilize valid Link Re-assignment and Twist Correction methods.**
