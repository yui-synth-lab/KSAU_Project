    "description": "We present KSAU v5.0, a phenomenological framework that models fermion Yukawa couplings as topological partition functions of knotted configurations motivated by Chern-Simons theory. Introducing a master constant K = T/24, the framework maps nine charged fermions to knots/links from the KnotInfo/LinkInfo census using an automated topology selection algorithm (17,154 entries) and achieves a global MAE of 1.38%. Key ingredients include a geometric action combining bulk hyperbolic volume, boundary crossing contributions, and a generational Twist correction; three geometric selection rules; and a numerical bridge between the Catalan constant and 7T/24. The manuscript provides explicit falsifiability criteria (neutrino mass range, fourth-generation exclusion, and a 12-crossing link prediction) and discusses limitations and open mathematical questions.",
