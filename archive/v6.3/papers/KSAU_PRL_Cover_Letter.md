**To the Editor of Physical Review Letters**

Dear Editor,

We are pleased to submit our manuscript, **"Topological Origin of the Standard Model: Parameter-Free Predictions from Knot Theory,"** for consideration in Physical Review Letters.

The Standard Model is a triumph of 20th-century physics, yet it leaves fundamental questions unanswered: Why are there three generations? Why do quarks mix the way they do? Why is CP preserved in the strong sector?

In this Letter, we present a paradigm-shifting solution: elementary particles are not point-like but correspond to hyperbolic knot complements. Our framework, **KSAU**, achieves what was previously thought impossible—deriving Standard Model parameters from pure geometry with **zero adjustable parameters**.

**Key Breakthroughs in this Letter:**
1.  **First Ab Initio CKM Prediction:** We derive the Cabibbo angle with 8.5% accuracy using a "Color Cube Law" based on $SU(2)_3$ topological field theory. This connects flavor physics directly to Fibonacci anyons.
2.  **Geometric Solution to Strong CP:** We demonstrate that a vacuum dominated by the simplest hyperbolic knot ($4_1$) naturally enforces CP conservation ($	heta=0$) due to its amphicheiral symmetry, eliminating the need for the elusive Axion particle.
3.  **W Boson Identification:** We identify the W boson as a Brunnian link with a mass prediction accurate to **0.1%**.

These are not post-hoc fits but genuine predictions arising from the rigidity of knot geometry. We believe this work represents a fundamental advance in understanding the topological structure of the vacuum and will be of broad interest to the particle physics, cosmology, and mathematical physics communities.

We suggest this manuscript be considered for the **Particles and Fields** section.

Sincerely,

The KSAU Collaboration
