# KSAU v6.6: Topological Gravity (Network Resource Gradient)

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** DRAFT / EXPLORATORY


## 1. The Principle of Resource Preference
In the KSAU network, every Reidemeister move requires one "Update Tick."

- **Massive Regions:** High $C$ (Crossing Number) means internal updates consume a large portion of local ticks.
- **Vacuum Regions:** Low $C$ ($0_1$ or $3_1$) means most ticks are available for spatial propagation ($dV$).

## 2. Gravity as an Update Density Gradient
Gravity is not a force, but the **Refractive Index of the Topological Network**.

- **Gravitational Potential ($\Phi$):** Proportional to the local "Update Density" $
ho_{u} = \frac{\Delta T_{avail}}{\Delta V}$.
- **Attraction Mechanism:** Particles naturally follow the path that minimizes "Topological Resistance." Because massive regions "dilute" the available update resources for motion, a particle moving near a mass is "refracted" toward the center of the resource drain.
- **Equivalence Principle:** Acceleration and gravity are equivalent because both involve the redistribution of update resources between internal complexity (mass) and external motion (velocity).

## 3. Gravitational Time Dilation
- Near a massive knot ($V \gg 0$), the local network clock is "busy" processing the internal crossings.
- To an outside observer in the "quiet" vacuum, the internal processes of the massive knot appear to take more global ticks to complete.
- **Conclusion:** Time slows down in a gravitational well because the network is "calculating" the mass.

## 4. The Field Equation (KSAU Version)
Instead of $G_{\mu
u} = 8\pi G T_{\mu
u}$, we propose:
$$
abla^2 (	ext{Update Density}) \propto 	ext{Complexity Density } (C/V)$$
The curvature of spacetime is the gradient of the network's refresh rate.
