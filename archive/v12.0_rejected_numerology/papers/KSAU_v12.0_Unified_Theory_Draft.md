## 1. Abstract
We report a numerical relationship between the electron mass and the Planck mass of the form $m_e \approx M_{Pl} \exp(-82\pi/5)$ with 0.58% precision. While the pattern is suggestive of a geometric origin from the 24-dimensional Leech lattice vacuum, Monte Carlo analysis reveals that this solution is not unique among simple rationals. We present this finding as a phenomenological hint rather than a derivation, emphasizing the need for rigorous group-theoretic proof.

## 2. Introduction
The search for a geometric origin of the Standard Model mass hierarchy led to the identification of several "resonance points" in previous versions. Version 12.0 explores the connection between the electroweak scale and the Planck scale. 

## 3. Numerical Observation
The hierarchy factor $X = \ln(M_{Pl}/m_e) \approx 51.53$ is found to be close to several simple multiples of $\pi$:
- $X \approx 16.4 \pi = 82\pi/5$ (Error in mass: +0.58%)
- $X \approx 1509\pi/92$ (Error in mass: +0.11%)

The appearance of the integer 82 is significant due to its recurrence in the Bottom quark mass shift ($n=82.5$ in v10.0/v11.0).

## 4. Statistical Analysis and Non-Uniqueness
A Monte Carlo test ($N=10,000$) yielded a p-value of 0.0016 for the existence of simple ratios giving <0.6% error. However, the discovery of more accurate ratios (e.g., $1509/92$) suggests that $82/5$ is a phenomenological choice based on simplicity rather than a derived necessity.

## 5. Conclusion
The electron mass formula is an interesting numerical coincidence that warrants further investigation into the Leech lattice Kaluza-Klein spectrum. However, it does not currently meet the standard for a "first-principles derivation." The primary focus of the KSAU project remains the rigorously verified electroweak and neutrino predictions of v11.0.
