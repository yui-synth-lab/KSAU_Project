# KSAU v12.0: Internal Working Paper (DEPRECATED)
**Authors:** KSAU Collaboration  
**Date:** February 15, 2026  
**Status:** ❌ REJECTED - INTERNAL WORKING PAPER (NUMEROLOGICAL WARNING)

## 1. Abstract
This document serves as a record of a failed attempt to derive the Standard Model mass hierarchy from first principles. While initial phenomenological observations (e.g., $1509/92$) showed high numerical precision (0.002%), rigorous audit revealed that the coefficients ($1509$) lack any unique geometric or group-theoretic origin. This draft is preserved solely as a cautionary example of **"Narrative Inflation"** and **"Pattern Matching Bias"** in AI-assisted research.

## 2. The Fallacy of the 1509/92 Identity
The proposed identity $X = \pi(1509/92)$ was briefly considered a breakthrough. However, independent verification confirmed that:
1. **Lack of Invariance:** The numerator 1509 (3 × 503) does not appear in the structure of the Leech lattice or the Conway group $Co_0$.
2. **Arbitrary Construction:** The decomposition $1509 = (24 \times 60) + (3 \times 23)$ is one of many possible linear combinations and lacks a physical derivation (action or symmetry).
3. **Statistical Bias:** Significance tests were found to be artificially constrained, inflating the perceived uniqueness of the result.

## 3. Retraction of Claims
The KSAU Collaboration formally retracts all claims of a "First-Principles Derivation" regarding the $M_{Pl}/m_e$ ratio in version 12.0. The results are classified as **Numerology** and are not suitable for scientific publication.

## 4. Conclusion and Corrective Action
The failure of v12.0 highlights the necessity of the **"Naked Truth"** principle. Future research must prioritize the rigorously verified results of v11.0 (Electroweak Mixing Angle) and maintain strict skepticism towards high-precision numerical coincidences that lack structural derivation.

**Core Status:**
v12.0 is **CLOSED**. No further development on this specific hierarchy formula is permitted until a stable group-theoretic invariant is identified.
