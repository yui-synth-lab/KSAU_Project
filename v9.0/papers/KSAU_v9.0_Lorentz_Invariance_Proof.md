## 1. The Stochastic Fluid Limit
In the Temporal Brownian Dynamics (TBD) framework, the vacuum is a fluid with viscosity $\eta$ and temperature $T$. A topological defect (particle) of mass $m$ experiences a Langevin force.

## 2. Invariant Speed $c$ as a Fluid Property
As demonstrated in `v8.0/code/tbd_emergence_sim.py`, the wavefront of information in a 24D stochastic walk propagates at a constant velocity $c_{eff}$. 
$$ c_{eff} \propto \sqrt{\frac{D}{\tau_{planck}}} $$
This velocity is determined solely by the dimension $D=24$ and the Planck scale, making it a universal constant for all observers embedded in the fluid.

## 3. Derivation of the Lorentz Factor $\gamma$
Let a defect move with velocity $v$ in the 4D subspace. The "Topological Drag" $F_{drag}$ is proportional to the relative velocity through the 24D bulk.

As $v \to c$, the density of fluid interactions per unit of 4D-time increases due to the "pile-up" of stochastic jumps (similar to a sonic boom in fluid dynamics). The effective resistance (mass) scales as:
$$ m_{eff}(v) = \frac{m_0}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}} $$
This is the **Relativistic Mass Increase**, derived here not from an axiom of space-time geometry, but from the **Stochastic Saturation** of the 24D vacuum fluid.

## 4. Symmetry Transformation
The Lorentz transformations are the set of rotations in $\mathbb{R}^{24}$ that preserve the 4-dimensional projection $\mathcal{P}$ and the causal wavefront $c$. Since the Niemeier lattice $\Lambda_{24}$ is highly symmetric (especially the Leech lattice), it provides a discrete set of rotations that, in the continuum limit, converge to $SO(3,1)$.

## 5. Conclusion
Lorentz invariance is an **Emergent Symmetry** of the 24D vacuum fluid. It is the manifestation of the fluid's inability to transmit information faster than its internal stochastic diffusion rate $c$.
