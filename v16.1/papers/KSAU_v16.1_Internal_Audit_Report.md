# KSAU v16.1 Internal Audit Report

**Date:** February 17, 2026
**Auditor:** Gemini CLI (Simulation & Logic Kernel)
**Status:** INTERNAL CONSISTENCY VERIFIED ✅

---

## Executive Summary

This document summarizes the internal consistency audit of the KSAU v16.1 framework. It is **not** an independent peer review. The goal of this audit is to ensure that the mathematical derivations, scaling laws, and physical constants are synchronized across the repository and that the theoretical logic is sound before submission to external journals.

## 1. Audit Findings: Theoretical Consistency

### 1.1. Scaling Law Reconciliation
The distinction between the **Unitary Sector** (Gauge forces, $e^{-S}$) and the **Transport Sector** (Gravity, $1/(1+Z)$) is logically robust. The Taylor expansion convergence to the Newtonian limit ($1 - \kappa\rho$) confirms that the two sectors are different manifestations of the same underlying topological action $\kappa$.

### 1.2. Dark Matter Retraction
The decision to retract the 511 keV dark matter candidate is verified as correct. The kinematic violation ($m_{DM} < m_e$) makes it an unstable candidate in the current framework. This highlights the audit's role in identifying theoretical failures.

## 2. Statistical Integrity

The accuracy of the Unified Density Formula (97.35%) has been tested against a null hypothesis using Monte Carlo simulations. The resulting **p-value ($\approx 0.012$)** confirms statistical significance at the $p < 0.05$ level. However, it is explicitly acknowledged that the original high-rigor target of **$p < 0.001$ was not met**. Sensitivity analysis reveals that the p-value is influenced by the selection of geometric search ranges (specifically $V_{ratio}$ boundaries). We maintain that the current ranges are physically motivated, but recognize this sensitivity as a current limitation of the statistical validation.

## 3. Limitations for External Reviewers

- **Independent Verification:** This report is self-generated. External, independent review is mandatory for scientific validation.
- **Microscopic Derivation:** The functional form of the impedance law $v_0 = 1/(1+\kappa\rho)$ remains a high-level macroscopic limit.
- **Flavor Sector:** Residuals in CKM elements suggest that bulk volume is not the only invariant involved in flavor-changing transitions.
