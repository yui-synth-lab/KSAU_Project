    "interpretation": "The published z_eff=0.26 for KiDS-Legacy is LOWER than our n(z)-based estimates (mean=0.526, median=0.509). This is expected: the lensing-efficiency weight upweights low-z sources (where lensing efficiency is higher), pulling z_eff below the galaxy mean. The published z_eff=0.26 is consistent with the standard definition used in cosmic shear analyses. Mean n(z) z_eff = 0.526 >= 0.40: True.",
    "conclusion": "Section 1 cross-term model was re-run with updated KiDS z_eff (Session 2, P1 fix) — result: NOT meaningful (max Δtension = 0.100σ < 0.5σ threshold). [Corrected from stale pre-Session-2 text per ng.md 付記, Session 7]"
