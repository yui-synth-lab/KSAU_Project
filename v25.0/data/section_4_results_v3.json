The auditor correctly noted that this specific combination — excluding T3 but including T4 — maximizes the apparent near-significance of T1. Session 3 correction: operative pool is now T1+T2 only (pre-registered-equivalent, matching the v24.0 test family). T1 p_Bonf=0.0334 under this 2-test correction. This is SIGNIFICANT (< 0.05), but based only on 5 LOO fold comparisons. 6th survey addition is required for conclusive determination.",
