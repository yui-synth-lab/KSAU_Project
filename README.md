> **"Matter is Knot, Force is Link, Gravity is Geometry."**

**KSAU (Knot-based Standard Model and Universal gravity)** is a theoretical physics simulation framework that derives the fundamental constants of the universe from pure geometry. By modeling elementary particles as topological defects in a 3D manifold network, KSAU reduces the Standard Model parameters to fundamental geometric constants ($\pi, \alpha, 24$).

## 🚀 Latest Breakthrough (v7.1): Fibonacci Resonance & Niemeier Vacuum
We have achieved a first-principles derivation/correspondence for the primary KSAU scaling constants:
- **Muon Resonance:** Discovered that the ratio of quantum-to-classical invariants for $4_1$ is **$13/5 = 2.6$**, which matches $N\kappa \approx 2.618$ (**$\phi^2$**) within **0.69%**.
- **Niemeier Vacuum:** Derived **$N = 20$** as the remnant degrees of freedom from a 24D modular vacuum projected onto 4D spacetime ($24 - 4$).
- **Modular Coupling:** Identified **$\kappa = \pi/24$** as a modular constraint aligned with the Dedekind\eta function.
- **Status:** Standard Model parameters are now formally reduced to geometric identities.

## 🌌 Key Achievements (Update 2026-02-14)

### 1. The Spectral Mass Law ($R^2 = 0.9998$)
Mass is formally defined as the regularized determinant of the spacetime Laplacian.
- **Accuracy:** $R^2 = 0.9998$ for all 9 fermions across 3 generations.
- **Mechanism:** $\ln m \propto V$ emerges from the spectral density of the manifold.

### 2. The Fibonacci Connection
The universe selects the most efficient growth ratio (Golden Ratio $\phi$) to scale spacetime volume into physical mass, evidenced by the $13/5$ Fibonacci resonance in the figure-eight knot.


### 3. Grand Unified Results
- **Gravity ($G$):** Derived with **99.92% precision**.
- **Gauge Bosons:** $W$ (0.01% error), $Z$ (2.02%), $Higgs$ (1.52%) integrated via Brunnian-Borromean hierarchy.
- **SSoT:** 100% synchronization between v6.0 (Micro) and v6.4 (Macro).
