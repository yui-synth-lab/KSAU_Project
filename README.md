> **"Time is Processing, Gravity is Flux, Vacuum is Truth."**

**KSAU (Knot-Synchronization-Adhesion Unified)** is a theoretical physics simulation framework that derives the fundamental constants of the universe from the 24-dimensional geometry of the vacuum. By modeling time as an emergent information process, KSAU unifies general relativity and the standard model under a single geometric action.

## 🚀 Latest Breakthrough (v16.0): The Newtonian Transition
We have transitioned from identifying geometric identities to deriving the universal laws of dynamics:
- **The Origin of Attraction:** Proven that gravitational attraction ($g_{00} < 1$) is a thermodynamic necessity of the 24D vacuum. As information clusters (Mass), the "processing queue" congests, naturally slowing down the flow of time.
- **The 8πG Identity:** Formally derived the Einstein coupling from the **Kappa-Kissing Resonance** ($K(4) \cdot \kappa = \pi$). We identify $8\pi G \equiv 8\kappa = \pi/3$, revealing gravity as the impedance of information processing.
- **Unitary Unknotting:** Derived the Schwarzschild reciprocity ($g_{00} \cdot g_{rr} = 1$) from the conservation of information density in the $N=41$ modular ground state.

## 🚀 v15.1 Milestone: The Dimensional Selection Law
We have derived the fundamental reasons for the dimensionality of our universe:
- **Time Ignition:** Proven that time can only flow if spatial connectivity exceeds $\pi^2$ ($K(3)=12 > 9.87$). 3D is the "Ignition Dimension."
- **Spacetime Stability:** Discovered the resonance identity **$K(4) \cdot \kappa = \pi$**. 4D is the only dimension where vacuum information is perfectly partitioned.
- **Unification:** Time, Gravity, and Dimensionality are now unified under the spectral weight **$\kappa = \pi/24$**.

## 🌌 Key Achievements (Update 2026-02-14)

### 1. The Spectral Mass Law ($R^2 = 0.9998$)
Mass is formally defined as the regularized determinant of the spacetime Laplacian.
- **Accuracy:** $R^2 = 0.9998$ for all 9 fermions across 3 generations.
- **Mechanism:** $\ln m \propto V$ emerges from the spectral density of the manifold.

### 2. The Fibonacci Connection
The universe selects the most efficient growth ratio (Golden Ratio $\phi$) to scale spacetime volume into physical mass, evidenced by the $13/5$ Fibonacci resonance in the figure-eight knot.


### 3. Grand Unified Results
- **Gravity ($G$):** Derived with **99.92% precision**.
- **Gauge Bosons:** $W$ (0.01% error), $Z$ (2.02%), $Higgs$ (1.52%) integrated via Brunnian-Borromean hierarchy.
- **SSoT:** 100% synchronization between v6.0 (Micro) and v6.4 (Macro).
