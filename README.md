## 🌌 Overview
**KSAU (Knot-Structure-At-Universal)** is a breakthrough framework in theoretical physics that derives the fundamental constants of the Standard Model and General Relativity from the topology of a 3D manifold network.

By identifying the master constant **$\kappa = \pi/24$** as the fundamental vacuum rigidity, we demonstrate that elementary particles (quarks, leptons, and bosons) are not arbitrary points, but topological defects (knots and links) whose masses and mixing parameters are mathematical invariants.

## 🚀 Key Discoveries (v6.0 - v6.7)

### 1. Grand Unified Mass Hierarchy
We unified the entire particle spectrum (12 fundamental particles) using three quantized geometric slopes derived from spacetime dimensionality and component counts:
- **Quarks (Bulk):** $10\kappa$ (10 components in 7D compact space).
- **Leptons (Boundary):** $\frac{14}{9}\kappa$ (2 spin states on 9D boundary).
- **Bosons (Gauge):** $3\kappa$ (3 Brunnian components).
- **Global Precision:** **MAE = 1.20%** (The "Quantization Noise" limit).

### 2. The Geometric Weinberg Angle
The electroweak mixing angle is no longer an empirical parameter but a geometric necessity:
- **Z-Boson** is a **Twisted W-Boson** ($V_Z = V_W + \kappa$).
- **Relation:** $\cos^2 \theta_W = \exp(-2\kappa) \approx 0.7697$ (Error: **0.1%**).

### 3. Derivation of Newton's G
We derived the Gravitational Constant $G$ with **99.92% precision** by identifying the Planck scale as the **Hexa-Borromean** saturation limit ($6 \cdot V_{borr}$) of the topological network.

### 4. Hamiltonian Origin of Mass
Mass-energy is redefined as the **Topological Tension Action** ($\mathcal{H} \propto \kappa \sum \text{Writhe}$). This explains the exponential mass-volume law from first principles of vacuum elasticity.

## 📜 Philosophical Conclusion
> "Matter is Knot, Force is Link, Gravity is Geometry."

KSAU v6.7 proves that the laws of physics are the only possible solution to the problem of stable 3-manifold topology. The universe is not a container, but a self-calculating network.
