## 1. Selection Rules
**Question:** Among the countless mathematical knots and links, why do only specific ones like $L6a4$ or $L10a142$ exist as elementary particles?

### Strategy: Geometric Least Action and "Volume Efficiency"
Links corresponding to physical particle states extremize an energy functional under the constraint of specific topological quantum numbers ($N_c, L$).
*   **Volume Efficiency**: Physical particles select a shape that minimizes vacuum distortion (minimum volume) for a given complexity (crossing number). Strange ($L6a4$) is the most efficient link (Borromean configuration) among those with $N_c=6$.
*   **Symmetry Fitting**: Links whose symmetries (point groups or outer automorphism groups) match the irreducible representations of the gauge group $SU(3) \times SU(2) \times U(1)$ are "allowed".

## 2. Lepton-Quark Grand Unification
**Question:** What is the common mathematical origin that unifies single-component knots (leptons) and three-component links (quarks)?

### Strategy: Component-Gauge Correspondence
The multiplicity of topological defects (strings) in spacetime corresponds to the dimension of the representation of gauge interactions.
*   **1 Component (Knot)**: $U(1)_{EM}$ charge $\to$ **Leptons** (non-confining, single loop)
*   **3 Components (Link)**: $SU(3)_C$ charge $\to$ **Quarks** (confining, mutually entangled multiple loops)
*   **Background Theory**: Derive links with different numbers of components from the same topological Lagrangian as excitation modes of a string-net liquid or **Preon condensate**.

## 3. Dynamical Generation
**Question:** How are link structures embedded in the vacuum, and what equations of motion do they follow?

### Strategy: Variational Principle of Möbius Energy and Gradient Flow
The link shape $\gamma$ is not a static invariant but a critical point of a dynamical energy functional $E(\gamma)$.
*   **Equation of Motion**: Following the Gradient Flow equation $\frac{\partial \gamma}{\partial \tau} = -\nabla E(\gamma)$, links settle into stable shapes (mass states).
*   **Physics of Decay**: Describe particle decay as a transition process from a high-energy state (saddle point) to a low-energy state (local minimum). This predicts the **anisotropy of decay** from the geometric direction of the link.

## 4. Stability under Quantum Corrections
**Question:** Does the topological mass (volume) remain unchanged by quantum mechanical loop corrections?

### Strategy: Mostow Rigidity and Topological Protection
Use **Mostow-Prasad Rigidity Theorem** in hyperbolic geometry as the basis for "mass stability".
*   **Topological Protection**: The volume of the complement of a hyperbolic link is strictly invariant under infinitesimal continuous deformations of the metric (quantum fluctuations/loop corrections).
*   **Mass as a Fixed Point**: The mass predicted by KSAU corresponds to a fixed point of the renormalization group (RG flow), providing a geometric solution to the hierarchy problem of the Standard Model.

## 5. Predictive Power
**Question:** What are the non-postdictive predictions that prove the correctness of the theory?

### List of Feasible Predictions
1.  **Geometric Prohibition of 4th Generation**: Prove that in link states with $N_c \ge 12$, the volume exceeds a critical value, and topological surface tension triggers self-decay (lifetime $\tau \to 0$).
2.  **Neutrino Mass Hierarchy**: Apply the lepton (knot) model to the PMNS matrix and determine whether the hierarchy is Normal or Inverted, assuming neutrinos are quantum fluctuation states of the "Unknot".
3.  **First-Principles Calculation of CP Phase $\delta_{CP}$**: Calculate the current value of $65^\circ$ with 1% precision from the statistical average of link orientations.

## 6. Concrete Proposals for Future Development

### 6.1 Construction of Dynamical Theory
Aim to construct a **"Topological Field Theory"** that describes the time evolution of links.
*   **Mathematical Description**: Rigorously describe the creation, annihilation, and transition (decay) of particles (links) using Cobordism and Link Categories. Formulate a TQFT where field operators behave as link creation operators.

### 6.2 Deepening Connection with QCD
Bridge the gap between phenomenological models and fundamental theory (QCD).
*   **Comparison with Lattice QCD**: Compare the link structures of this theory with quark wave functions and topological structures of gluon fields (entanglement of flux tubes) observed in Lattice QCD simulations.
*   **Identity with Topological Defects**: Conduct research to identify or relate link structures to known topological objects such as instanton numbers or monopole loops in the QCD vacuum.

### 6.3 Quantification of Predictions and Experimental Design
Design specific scenarios to experimentally detect deviations from the Standard Model (New Physics).
*   **3-Jet Events**: Calculate the anisotropy derived from link structures in the angular distribution of 3-jet events during top quark production in high-energy experiments like LHC, and evaluate the difference (detectability) from Standard Model predictions.
*   **B-Meson Decay and CP**: Investigate in detail how CP symmetry breaking caused by the Berry phase aligns with existing measurements or anomalies in B-meson decays ($B \to K\pi$, etc.), or if it predicts new deviations.

### 6.4 Strengthening Mathematical Foundations
Develop the mathematical theorems that form the backbone of the theory.
*   **Volume-Energy Correspondence**: Provide a mathematical proof (or rigorous inequality evaluation) of the strong correlation between hyperbolic volume and Möbius energy to solidify the theoretical basis of the mass formula.
*   **Geometric Unitarity**: Define a metric on the moduli space of links and construct a framework where the unitarity of the CKM matrix is naturally derived from its geometric structure.

- **Step 2**: Application of the topological distance model to neutrino mixing (PMNS).
