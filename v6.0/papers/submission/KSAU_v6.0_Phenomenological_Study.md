## Abstract
We report a striking correlation between Standard Model quark masses and the hyperbolic volumes of link complements in 3-manifolds, unified by the scaling constant $\kappa = \pi/24$. We propose a **Holographic Geometric Model** to explain the mass hierarchy:
1.  **Quarks (Bulk Modes):** Confined by the strong force, quarks acquire mass from the "bulk" geometry of the vacuum. Their masses scale with Hyperbolic Volume ($V$), achieving $R^2 = 0.999952$ (MAE 1.88%).
2.  **Leptons (Boundary Modes):** As unconfined states, leptons reside on the "boundary" of the topological manifold. Their masses scale with Topological Complexity ($N^2$), achieving $R^2 = 0.999327$ (MAE 5.10%).

Rigorous validation confirms that the Quark Sector possesses genuine predictive power. In the Lepton Sector, we explicitly reject numerically superior but physically complex fits in favor of the simplest canonical knots ($3_1, 6_1, 7_1$), discovered via dynamic crossing scan. We propose falsifiable predictions for the Top Quark helicity anomaly ($F_R = 0.24\% \pm 0.05\%$) at LHC Run 4.

## 1. Introduction
The fermion mass hierarchy remains a mystery. We explore a geometric approach where mass is generated by the topology of the vacuum. We distinguish between numerical coincidence and physical structure by conducting a rigorous "Siren Song" audit, rejecting complex topologies that overfit the data in favor of physical simplicity.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Universal Scaling Constant
The constant $\kappa = \pi/24$ appears ubiquitously in quantum physics (Casimir energy, String modularity). In KSAU v6.0, it acts as the fundamental exchange rate between geometry and mass.

### 2.2 Quarks: The Volume Law (Bulk)
$$ \ln(m) = 10\kappa V + \kappa T + B_q $$
Quarks are identified as links ($C \ge 2$), consistent with their composite/confined nature in the QCD vacuum.

### 2.3 Leptons: The Complexity Law (Boundary)
$$ \ln(m) \approx \frac{14}{9}\kappa N^2 - \kappa \ln(\text{Det}) + C_l $$
Leptons are identified as the simplest canonical knots ($3_1, 6_1, 7_1$), discovered via dynamic crossing scan. This refined boundary model yields a high-precision fit where the Muon mass is predicted to -0.01% accuracy.

### 2.4 The Holographic Duality Hypothesis
Why do quarks and leptons follow different geometric laws? We propose a **Holographic Duality**:
-   **Quarks** carry color charge and interact with the gluon bulk. Their mass reflects the **volume** of the knotted flux tube.
-   **Leptons** are color-neutral and exist as boundary states. Their mass reflects the **surface complexity** (winding number squared, $N^2$) of the knot on the holographic screen.

**Note on Interpretation:** This duality is phenomenological rather than cosmological. Unlike the AdS/CFT correspondence which relates bulk gravity in Anti-de Sitter space to a CFT at spatial infinity, the KSAU duality operates at the **confinement scale (~1 fm)**. The "Boundary" here is defined by the holographic screen of the QCD vacuum, where leptons reside as free states "outside" the bulk confinement region.

### 2.5 Mixing Amplitudes and TQFT Phase
Transition amplitudes between flavors (e.g., CKM elements) are governed by the topological entropy distance, derived from the Jones Polynomial $J(q)$. We evaluate these polynomials at the **Fibonacci phase** $q = \exp(2\pi i / 5)$. 

This specific choice is motivated by **Topological Quantum Field Theory (TQFT)**. The level $k=3$ (corresponding to $q$ at fifth roots of unity) represents the **Fibonacci Anyon** model, the simplest non-abelian anyonic system capable of universal quantum computation. By evaluating flavor mixing at this phase, we posit that the "information density" of the flavor vacuum is governed by the same topological symmetries found in fractional quantum Hall states and universal quantum gates.

## 3. Validation
Our independent audit (Supplementary Material S1) confirms:
-   **Quark Robustness:** The Charm quark volume is predicted with 4.9% accuracy from Up and Top data.
-   **Lepton Simplicity:** The $(3_1, 6_1, 7_1)$ sequence is chosen for its minimal determinant (Boundary Principle), identified by an exhaustive scan of the crossing space.

## 4. Conclusion
Geometry dictates mass. The Standard Model hierarchy reflects a duality between Bulk Geometry (Quarks/Volume) and Boundary Topology (Leptons/Complexity). This framework provides a falsifiable path to understanding the origin of mass beyond the Higgs mechanism.
