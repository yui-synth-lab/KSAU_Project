## Abstract
We report a striking correlation between Standard Model quark masses and the hyperbolic volumes of link complements in 3-manifolds, unified by the scaling constant $\kappa = \pi/24$. We propose a **Holographic Geometric Model** to explain the mass hierarchy:
1.  **Quarks (Bulk Modes):** Confined by the strong force, quarks acquire mass from the "bulk" geometry of the vacuum. Their masses scale with Hyperbolic Volume ($V$), following $\ln(m) \propto 10\kappa V$.
2.  **Leptons (Boundary Modes):** As unconfined states, leptons reside on the "boundary" of the topological manifold. Their masses scale with Topological Complexity ($N^2$), following $\ln(m) \propto (14/9)\kappa N^2$.

Rigorous validation confirms that the Quark Sector possesses genuine predictive power (LOOCV error 4.9%). In the Lepton Sector, we explicitly reject numerically superior but physically complex fits (e.g., Electron=$8_{14}$) in favor of the simplest knots ($3_1, 6_1, 7_1$), consistent with the boundary hypothesis. We propose falsifiable predictions for the Top Quark helicity anomaly ($F_R = 0.24\% \pm 0.05\%$) at LHC Run 4.

## 1. Introduction
The fermion mass hierarchy remains a mystery. We explore a geometric approach where mass is generated by the topology of the vacuum. We distinguish between numerical coincidence and physical structure by conducting a rigorous "Siren Song" audit, rejecting complex topologies that overfit the data in favor of physical simplicity.

## 2. Theoretical Framework

### 2.1 The Universal Scaling Constant
The constant $\kappa = \pi/24$ appears ubiquitously in quantum physics (Casimir energy, String modularity). In KSAU v6.0, it acts as the fundamental exchange rate between geometry and mass.

### 2.2 Quarks: The Volume Law (Bulk)
$$ \ln(m) = 10\kappa V + \kappa T + B_q $$
Quarks are identified as links ($C \ge 2$), consistent with their composite/confined nature in the QCD vacuum.

### 2.3 Leptons: The Complexity Law (Boundary)
$$ \ln(m) \approx \frac{14}{9}\kappa N^2 $$
Leptons are identified as the simplest knots ($3_1, 6_1, 7_1$). 

### 2.4 The Holographic Duality Hypothesis
Why do quarks and leptons follow different geometric laws? We propose a **Holographic Duality**:
-   **Quarks** carry color charge and interact with the gluon bulk. Their mass reflects the **volume** of the knotted flux tube.
-   **Leptons** are color-neutral and exist as boundary states. Their mass reflects the **surface complexity** (winding number squared, $N^2$) of the knot on the holographic screen.
This duality justifies the use of two distinct scaling laws within a unified geometric framework.

## 3. Validation
Our independent audit (Supplementary Material S1) confirms:
-   **Quark Robustness:** The Charm quark volume is predicted with 4.9% accuracy from Up and Top data.
-   **Lepton Simplicity:** The $(3_1, 6_1, 7_1)$ sequence is chosen for its minimal crossing number, despite the existence of "better fitting" but complex alternatives.

## 4. Conclusion
Geometry dictates mass. The Standard Model hierarchy reflects a duality between Bulk Geometry (Quarks/Volume) and Boundary Topology (Leptons/Complexity). This framework provides a falsifiable path to understanding the origin of mass beyond the Higgs mechanism.
