Dear Editor,

We are submitting our manuscript, **"Geometric Origin of the Quark Mass Hierarchy and Flavor Mixing: A Holographic Approach,"** for consideration as an Article in *Physical Review D*.

Our paper reports a significant discovery in the Standard Model: the emergence of a robust geometric scaling law governing the quark mass hierarchy. Using the master constant $\kappa = \pi/24$—derived from vacuum Casimir energy and modular invariance—we demonstrate that quark masses (Bulk modes) are dictated by the hyperbolic volumes ($V$) of vacuum defects. This **Universal Volume Law** achieves an unprecedented\log-scale correlation of **$R^2 = 0.999952$** and a Mean Absolute Error of **1.88%** across six orders of magnitude.

While we also present a related complexity-based scaling for leptons and an exploratory Logit-Geometric model for CKM mixing ($R^2 \approx 0.67$), the primary discovery lies in the rigorous geometric foundation of the quark sector. A critical feature of our work is the **"Siren Song" Audit**, where we explicitly investigated and rejected numerically superior fits (achieving $R^2 = 1.00$) in favor of the simplest, physically natural topologies (e.g., Electron=$3_1$). This commitment to physical naturalness ensures the theory remains grounded in reality rather than statistical coincidence.

The constant $\kappa = \pi/24$ provides a theoretical bridge between 3D vacuum topology and zero-point energies. We provide a falsifiable prediction for the Top Quark helicity anomaly ($F_R = 0.24\% \pm 0.05\%$) to be tested at LHC Run 4.

Given the high statistical significance and the clear physical picture provided by the bulk-boundary duality, we believe this work represents a major step toward a geometric foundation for the Standard Model.
