Dear Editor,

We are submitting our manuscript, **"Empirical Correlation Between Quark Masses and Knot Complement Volumes: A Holographic Geometric Model,"** for consideration as an Article in *Physical Review D*.

Our paper reports a significant discovery in the Standard Model fermion mass hierarchy: the emergence of two distinct geometric scaling laws unified by the master constant $\kappa = \pi/24$.

By applying the **Holographic Duality Hypothesis**, we demonstrate that:
1.  **Quark masses (Bulk modes)** scale with hyperbolic volume ($V$), reflecting their confinement in the QCD vacuum ($R^2 = 0.999956$).
2.  **Lepton masses (Boundary modes)** scale with topological complexity ($N^2$), reflecting their nature as free states ($R^2 = 0.999994$).

A unique feature of this work is our rigorous **"Siren Song" Audit**. We explicitly investigated numerically superior fits (achieving $R^2 = 1.00$) in the knot database but rejected them in favor of physically natural, simpler topologies (e.g., Electron=$3_1$). This "Simplicity Principle" over numerical overfitting ensures the theory remains grounded in physical reality.

The constant $\kappa = \pi/24$ provides a theoretical bridge between 3D vacuum topology and zero-point energies in QFT and String Theory. We provide a falsifiable prediction for the Top Quark helicity anomaly ($F_R = 0.24\% \pm 0.05\%$) to be tested at LHC Run 4.

Given the high statistical precision and the clear physical picture provided by the bulk-boundary duality, we believe this work represents a major step toward a geometric foundation for the Standard Model.
