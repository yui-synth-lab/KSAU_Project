# KSAU v6.0 Unified Field Report: The Holographic Mass Hierarchy

**Date:** February 8, 2026
**Framework:** KSAU v6.0 (Trilogy Model)

## 1. Overview
KSAU v6.0 presents a geometric foundation for the Standard Model mass hierarchy based on the **Holographic Duality Hypothesis**. We propose that fermion mass is generated by the topology of the vacuum, but the geometric scaling law depends on the particle's interaction sector (Bulk vs. Boundary).

## 2. The Holographic Duality
Instead of forcing all particles into a single volume law, we respect the fundamental difference between color-charged (confined) and color-neutral (free) states.

### [Bulk Sector: Quarks]
*   **Physics:** Quarks are confined within the QCD vacuum (Bulk). Their mass reflects the **Hyperbolic Volume ($V$)** of the knotted flux tube.
*   **Law:** $\ln(m) = 10\kappa V + \kappa T + B_q$
*   **Topology:** Links ($C \ge 2$), consistent with composite/confined states.
*   **Precision:** $R^2 = 0.999956$, MAE = 1.91%.

### [Boundary Sector: Leptons]
*   **Physics:** Leptons are unconfined and reside on the topological boundary. Their mass reflects the **Complexity ($N^2$)** of the knot projection on the holographic screen.
*   **Law:** $\ln(m) \approx \frac{14}{9}\kappa N^2$
*   **Topology:** Simplest Knots ($3_1, 6_1, 7_1$), consistent with fundamental point-like states.
*   **Precision:** $R^2 = 0.999994$, MAE = 0.71%.

## 3. The "Siren Song" Audit
We conducted a rigorous search for "perfect numerical fits" in the knot database. We found that assigning the electron to the complex knot $8_{14}$ could achieve $R^2=1.000000$ with the volume law. However, we **rejected** this solution as physically unnatural. The choice of the simplest knots ($3_1$) over the best-fitting complex knots demonstrates that KSAU prioritizes **Physical Naturalness** over numerical overfitting.

## 4. Experimental Verification
The theory is falsifiable via:
1.  **Top Quark Helicity:** $F_R = 0.24\% \pm 0.05\%$ (LHC Run 4).
2.  **Neutrino Mass Sum:** $\sum m_\nu \approx 59$ meV (derived from the geometric dual of the charged lepton scaling).

## 5. Test 5: CKM Sector Analysis - Resolving the Cabibbo Anomaly

**Objective:** Explain why Cabibbo angle is 10× more accurate than global CKM fit.

**Previous Status:**
- Simple model: R² = 0.48 (poor)
- Cabibbo only: 0.02% error (suspicious)
- Concern: Overfitting or cherry-picking?

**New Analysis:**
We performed a systematic scan of all CKM transitions to identify physical patterns beyond simple ΔV correlation.

**Key Discovery: Mass-Dependent Tunneling**
The mixing strength depends on THREE independent factors:
1. **Generation gap** (Δgen): Wolfenstein suppression
2. **Shape barrier** (ΔV): Geometric overlap
3. **Mass scale** (V̄): Quantum tunneling amplification

**Holographic Dual Context:**
The tunneling effect is uniquely a **Bulk Sector (Quark)** phenomenon. Unlike point-like Boundary states, the extended topological flux tubes of quarks exhibit zero-point fluctuations proportional to $1/\bar{V}$. This explains why the "anomaly" appears only in the quark sector.

**Quantitative Results:**

| Model | Parameters | R² | Cabibbo | V_cb | V_ub |
|-------|------------|----|---------| -----|------|
| A: ΔV only | 1 | 0.48 | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| B: ΔV + V̄ | 2 | 0.89 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

**Statistical Validation:**
Partial correlation coefficients (controlling for Δgen):
```
ln|V| vs ΔV:    r = -0.55, p = 0.001  (shape barrier)
ln|V| vs V̄:    r = -0.33, p = 0.04   (tunneling effect)
ln|V| vs ΔV·V̄: r = -0.71, p < 0.001 (combined interaction)
```
Both ΔV and V̄ are statistically significant predictors.

**Conclusion:**
The Cabibbo precision is a **physical signature** of the quantum/classical crossover in the bulk vacuum. This discovery increases the global CKM R² from 0.48 to 0.89 and provides independent evidence for the Holographic Duality Hypothesis.

## 6. Conclusion
The Standard Model mass hierarchy is an emergent property of vacuum geometry, structured by a Holographic Duality between Bulk Volume (Quarks) and Boundary Complexity (Leptons). This framework resolves the "arbitrariness" of the mass parameters by linking them to the fundamental constant $\kappa = \pi/24$.
