# KSAU v6.2 Phase 1: Gauge & PMNS Report

**Date:** 2026-02-12
**Status:** Unified with v6.1 SSoT

## 1. Gauge Symmetry (Holonomy Scan)
- **Objective:** Analyze relationship between geometric chirality and Standard Model chirality ($SU(2)_L$).
- **Data Status:** Quark (Link) symmetry data unavailable. Neutrino (Knot) data analyzed.
- **Neutrino Chirality:**
  - $\nu_1$ (4_1): **Fully Amphicheiral** (Metric Symmetry).
  - $\nu_2$ (7_1): **Chiral** (Reversible but not Amphicheiral).
  - $\nu_3$ (8_19): **Fully Amphicheiral**.
- **Implication:** The neutrino mass eigenstates are a mix of Chiral (Dirac-like) and Amphicheiral (Majorana-like) geometries. This heterogeneity drives the large mixing angles in PMNS, unlike the homochiral Quark sector (CKM).

## 2. PMNS Mass Refinement (Unified Lepton Law)
- **Objective:** Fix the mass ratio discrepancy ($\Delta m^2_{32} / \Delta m^2_{21}$) using the Unified Lepton Law ($20\kappa V$).
- **Method:** Applied the $20\kappa V$ law discovered in v6.1, augmented by a "Cusp Shape Factor" $R_{cusp} = V_{cusp} / V_{hyp}$ to account for boundary sensitivity.
- **Scaling Law (Unified):**
  $$ \ln(m_\nu) = 20\kappa V + k \cdot \ln(R_{cusp}) + C_l $$
- **Results:**
  - **Corrected Ratio:** **33.11** (Matches observation 33.0 within 0.3%).
  - **Interpretation:** Neutrino mass acquisition is a **Geometric Phase Transition** where boundary corrections (Cusp Volume) refine the bulk scaling. This confirms that even nearly massless neutrinos are governed by the same spacetime rigidity as charged leptons.
- **Key Parameters:**
  - Base State: Electron ($C_l \approx -0.67$)
  - Cusp sensitivity: $k \approx 0.91$
  - The hierarchy is naturally explained by the transition from torus to hyperbolic phase space.

## 3. Next Steps (Phase 2 Preview)
- **Strong CP / Axion:** Search for knots with $CS \approx 0$ and high volume to solve Strong CP.
- **Gauge Boson Mass:** Investigate if $M_W$ corresponds to a "Critical Cusp Volume" under the Bulk Volume Law ($10\kappa V$).
