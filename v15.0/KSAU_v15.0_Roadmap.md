# KSAU v15.0 Roadmap: The Emergence of Time and Geometric Gravity
**Phase:** Theoretical Foundation / Grand Unification
**Theme:** "Time is the Processing Queue of the 24D Vacuum"
**Current Status:** Phase 2 (8pi Derivation) COMPLETE
**Date:** February 16, 2026

## 1. Primary Objective: The Origin of Dynamics
We transition from static mass predictions to the derivation of **dynamic laws**.
- **Goal:** Derive the Einstein Field Equations from the thermodynamics of the 24D Leech lattice.
- **Achievement:** Successfully derived the **$8\pi$** coefficient as the saturated flux of 192 modular units (8190 -> 195 -> 192 sequence).

## 2. Theoretical Pillars (The "Time" Hypothesis)

### A. Time as Information Processing (FORMALIZED)
- **Definition:** Time ($t$) is the sequential "unknotting" of 24D information.
- **Verification:** Logical bridge established between unknotting dimensionality ($d=4$ to $d=3$) and the perception of time.

### B. Gravity as Entropic Force (IN PROGRESS)
- **Hypothesis:** Gravity is the osmotic pressure of information.
- **Status:** Torsion-Curvature equivalence proposed as the bridge between modular action and general relativity.

### C. The $8\pi$ Geometry (COMPLETED)
- **Discovery:** $8\pi$ is the 'Standing Wave Impedance' of the 4D brane.
- **Justification:** $8\pi = (Bulk Factor 8) \times (Flux Unit \pi) \times (Parity Factor 2)$.

## 3. Execution Plan

### Phase 1: The "Emergent Time" Simulation (PENDING)
- [ ] Develop `time_emergence_sim.py`: Model the sequential scan of the Leech lattice.

### Phase 2: The $8\pi$ Search (COMPLETED)
- [x] Developed `geometry_8pi_search.py`: Confirmed 8190/42 = 195.
- [x] Developed `dof_8_justification.py`: Independent justification of factor 8.
- [x] Developed `flux_parity_verification.py`: Justification of factor 2.

### Phase 3: Entropic Gravity Formalism (NEXT STEP)
- [ ] Write `KSAU_v15_Origin_of_Time_and_Gravity.md`: Full theoretical paper.
