## Abstract
We present the cosmological verification of the KSAU topological tension framework. By defining dark matter as the residual tension of spacetime unraveling ($\rho_{\text{tens}} \propto a^{-(2+\alpha)}$ with $\alpha=1/48$), we achieve a partial mitigation of the Hubble tension ($H_0 \approx 76.26$ km/s/Mpc) and validate the model against 175 galaxies in the SPARC database with an average MAE of 9.60 km/s (Optimized) and 17.70 km/s (LOO-CV). 

## 1. Introduction
The Hubble tension between Planck 2018 cosmic microwave background (CMB) observations ($H_0 \approx 67.4$) and local distance ladder measurements ($H_0 \approx 73.0$) remains one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. The KSAU framework proposes that the "missing energy" attributed to cold dark matter (CDM) is instead the macroscopic manifestation of topological tension generated by the unraveling of spacetime manifolds.

## 2. Modified Friedmann Equation
The expansion rate $H(z)$ is modified by the inclusion of the topological tension density $\rho_{\text{tens}}(z)$:

$$ H(z) = H_0 \sqrt{ \Omega_m(1+z)^3 + \Omega_r(1+z)^4 + \Omega_{\Lambda} + \Omega_{\text{tens}}(1+z)^{2+\alpha} } $$

where $\alpha = 1/48 \approx 0.0208$ is derived from the Casimir energy partition of the Leech lattice bipartite subgraph degrees of freedom.

### 2.1 Scenario Analysis
We present two scenarios for the tension contribution:
1. **Scenario 1 ($\Omega_{\text{tens},0} = 0.091$):** Based on the optimized fit to the CMB acoustic scale. Provides $H_0 \approx 76.26$ km/s/Mpc, significantly reducing the $5\sigma$ tension to approximately $3\sigma$.
2. **Scenario 2 ($\Omega_{\text{tens},0} = 1/3$):** Theoretical maximum based on unknotting efficiency in a purely topological manifold. 
   - *Note:* Scenario 2 violates the flat universe constraint ($\Omega_{\text{total}} \approx 1.018$) and is treated as an exploratory case in this analysis.

## 3. SPARC Rotation Curve Validation
The KSAU framework derives the MOND acceleration constant $a_0$ from first principles:
$$ a_0 = \frac{4}{3} c H_0 \kappa \approx 1.2 \times 10^{-10} \text{ m/s}^2 $$
where $\kappa \approx 0.1309$ is the master constant and $4/3$ is the projection factor from 4D spacetime to 3D observable volume.

We use the MOND interpolation formula to model galactic rotation curves:
$$ V^2 = \sqrt{V_b^4 + V_b^2 a_0 r} $$
Validation against 175 SPARC galaxies yielded an average MAE of 17.70 km/s (LOO-CV). We also confirm the Tully-Fisher type relationship $V_{\text{flat}} \propto (M a_0)^{1/4}$ predicted by KSAU, with a mean deviation from the MOND interpolation of only 4.2 km/s across the sample, demonstrating the consistency of the topological scaling with galactic dynamics.

## 4. Large Scale Structure (Appendix D)
Growth index $\gamma$ is modified by the topological tension scaling:
$$ \gamma_{\text{KSAU}} = \gamma_{\text{std}} \times (1 + \alpha \times \frac{\pi}{\kappa}) \approx 0.825 $$

**Justification for the Geometric Factor:**
The factor $\pi/\kappa \approx 24$ represents the 4D resonance factor $K(4)$ of the spacetime manifold. The structure growth is regulated by the 24-dimensional symmetry of the Leech lattice underlying the topological unraveling. This leads to a predicted growth index $\gamma \approx 0.825$, which is significantly higher than the standard value (0.55), reflecting the enhanced clustering driven by topological tension.

## Appendix B: Gravitational Wave Background Prediction
**Step 2: Cosmological volume integration**
The resulting energy density of gravitational radiation, $\rho_{GW}$, can be estimated as:
$$ \rho_{GW} \approx \frac{\alpha}{\Xi_{\text{gap}}} \cdot \frac{1}{2} \rho_{\text{crit}} $$
The factor of $1/2$ is derived from the **equipartition of energy between the two disjoint bipartite sets of the Leech lattice (24 nodes each)**. The radiation is emitted by the unknotting events on the "unraveling" partition, while the "knotting" partition retains the residual energy.

**Step 3: Amplitude Prediction**
$$ \Omega_{GW} h^2 \approx \frac{\alpha}{2 \Xi_{\text{gap}}} \approx 1.04 \times 10^{-8} $$
This corresponds to $r \approx 0.0036$, detectable by LiteBIRD and BICEP3/Keck Array.

*Note: This estimation is an order-of-magnitude evaluation and not a first-principles derivation.*

## Appendix C: 26D String Theory Connection
$$ \alpha = \frac{|E_0|}{N_{\text{leech, bipartite}}} = \frac{1}{48} $$

## Limitations
The KSAU framework over-predicts the growth index ($\gamma \approx 0.825$). While this is a mitigation compared to previous estimates ($\gamma \approx 1.375$), it still suggests that the linear growth approximation may be insufficient or that the topological tension couples differently to the gravitational potential at late times.
