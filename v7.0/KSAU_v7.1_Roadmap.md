# KSAU v7.1 Roadmap: From Discrete Invariants to Statistical TQFT

**Version:** 7.1
**Date:** 2026-02-14
**Status:** ACTIVE

## Overview
Following the refutation of the $N=3$ (Kashaev) hypothesis for the Tau sector in $6_1$, v7.1 shifts focus from discrete local invariants to the global spectral geometry of the spacetime manifold. 

**Grand Objective:** To prove that the parameters of the Standard Model (masses, couplings) are not arbitrary constants, but are uniquely determined by the **Spectral Geometry of a 24-dimensional Vacuum**. We aim to reduce $\kappa, N,$ and $\alpha$ to fundamental geometric constants like $\pi$ and the Niemeier rank (24).

## Priority 1: Topological Correction Search (COMPLETED - Negative)

**Goal:** Determine if a different topology satisfies the $N=3$ relation for Tau.

- **Result:** **FAILED.** Exact calculation for $7_3$ yields $\langle 7_3 \rangle_3 = 1$. Discrete invariants are proven to be non-universal and prone to "Identity Collapse" at $N=3$ for non-twist knots.

- **Conclusion:** Reassignment is rejected. The $N=3$ agreement for Muon is identified as a localized "Double Resonance."



## Priority 2: Spectral Geometry and Double Resonance (ACTIVE)

**Goal:** Establish the physical origin of the $\ln(m) \propto V$ relationship using the ratio of Quantum/Classical invariants.

- **Breakthrough:** Discovery that $\langle 4_1 \rangle_3 / \tau(4_1) = 13 / 5 = 2.6$, matching the KSAU effective coefficient $N \cdot \kappa \approx 2.618$.

- **Task:** Verify the "Double Resonance" ratio for the Tau sector ($6_1$) and investigate higher-order torsion.

- **Hypothesis:** Mass generation is the ratio of Quantum Topological Complexity to Classical Analytic Torsion.



## Priority 3: Modular Origin of $\kappa = \pi/24$ (Mid-term)
**Goal:** Derive $\kappa$ from vacuum constraints.
- **Task:** Map the connection between the 24 Niemeier Lattices and the KSAU coupling.
- **Hypothesis:** $\kappa = \pi/24$ is a global constraint dictated by the stability of the 24-dimensional even unimodular lattices in the vacuum.
- **Output:** Theoretical justification for $\kappa$ in the v7.1 draft paper.

## Priority 4: Phase Transition Modeling (Long-term)
**Goal:** Explain the sector-specific scaling ($N=20$ for leptons vs $N=8$ for quarks).
- **Hypothesis:** $N$ represents effective degrees of freedom that "freeze out" during topological phase transitions.
- **Requirement:** Success of Priorities 2 and 3.
