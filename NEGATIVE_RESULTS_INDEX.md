# KSAU Framework: Negative Results Index & Status Report

**Status:** ACTIVE | v36.0 Final Archive
**Date:** 2026-02-21
**Purpose:** To provide external researchers with a definitive, honest map of the KSAU framework's limitations, rejected hypotheses, and statistical boundaries.

> **Note to Researchers:** The KSAU project prioritizes scientific integrity. We report negative results and "closed pathways" with the same rigor as successful predictions. This index lists all hypotheses that have been rigorously tested and **rejected**.

## 1. Definitively Rejected Hypotheses (Closed Pathways)

These pathways have been exhaustively explored and mathematically proved to be dead ends.

### 1.1 Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) Derivation of Factor 7
- **Hypothesis:** The multiplicative mass factor $q_{mult}=7$ arises from the central charge or level scaling of a WZW model associated with the Leech lattice.
- **Status:** **CLOSED (Mathematical Impossibility)**
- **Reason:**
  - **Standard WZW:** Sugawara construction yields rational central charges; factor 7 is not a generic integer consequence.
  - **Curved/Coset WZW:** Geometric invariants do not naturally produce an integer scaling of 7.
  - **Conclusion:** $q_{mult}=7$ is a **Free Parameter** of the theory, not a derived geometric constant.

### 1.2 Geometric Derivation of Fine Structure Constant ($\alpha_{em}$)
- **Hypothesis:** $\alpha_{em}$ can be derived purely from lattice geometry (e.g., $\pi/432$).
- **Status:** **REJECTED (Statistical False Positive)**
- **Reason:** Monte Carlo simulations reveal a False Positive Rate (FPR) of **87%**. The density of simple geometric fractions is too high to distinguish a true signal from numerology.

### 1.3 Algebraic Map $Co_0 	o G_2$
- **Hypothesis:** There exists a direct algebraic homomorphism or subgroup relation between the Leech automorphism group $Co_0$ and the exceptional Lie group $G_2$.
- **Status:** **REJECTED (Group Theory Mismatch)**
- **Reason:** ATLAS of Finite Groups confirms no such maximal subgroup or representation exists. $G_2$ cannot be embedded into $Co_0$ in a way that generates the particle spectrum.

### 1.4 Compactification Dimension ($D_{bulk\_compact} = 7$)
- **Hypothesis:** The number of compact dimensions (7) is a prediction of KSAU.
- **Status:** **TAUTOLOGY (Not a Prediction)**
- **Reason:** Defined as $11 (	ext{M-theory}) - 4 (	ext{Spacetime}) = 7$. This is an input assumption, not an output prediction.

## 2. Statistical Limitations (Bonferroni Failed)

These results showed initial promise (raw $p < 0.05$) but failed rigorous multiple-testing corrections.

### 2.1 Section 2: CS Duality (Mass Spectrum)
- **Claim:** The topological mass formula correlates with quark/lepton masses ($k \approx 25$).
- **Raw p-value:** $0.0078$
- **Bonferroni Status:** **FAIL ($p > 0.0050$)**
- **Correction Factor:** $n=10$ (10 independent grid searches).
- **Final Verdict:** **EXPLORATORY-SIGNIFICANT**. Interesting, but not statistically robust enough to claim discovery.

### 2.2 Section 3: LSS Coherence ($BAO/R \approx 7$)
- **Claim:** The ratio of BAO scale to Leech radius is exactly 7.
- **Raw p-value:** $0.032$
- **Bonferroni Status:** **FAIL ($p > 0.0167$)**
- **Correction Factor:** $n=3$ (Tested 7, $e^2$, $22/3$).
- **Final Verdict:** **NOT SIGNIFICANT**. Indistinguishable from random chance.

### 2.3 $N_{Leech}^{1/4} / r_s \approx 7$
- **Claim:** Leech lattice order relates to sound horizon.
- **Status:** **NOT SIGNIFICANT**.
- **Reason:** Pure coincidence.

## 3. Validated & Open Results (The Surviving Core)

The following components remain scientifically valid and statistically supported.

### 3.1 $S_8$ Cosmological Tension Resolution
- **Claim:** KSAU predicts a scale-dependent suppression of $S_8$ at $z \sim 1$.
- **Status:** **STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT ($p=0.00556$)**
- **Method:** 7-survey permutation test (5040 perms).
- **Validation:** Verification design for Euclid/LSST created (v36.0 Task A).

### 3.2 CKM Matrix Fitting
- **Claim:** Logit-based geometric formula fits CKM elements.
- **Status:** **ESTABLISHED ($R^2 = 0.998$)**
- **Caveat:** Uses 5 free parameters for 9 observables. High fit quality is expected but the specific geometric form is robust.

### 3.3 Hubble Constant ($H_0$)
- **Prediction:** $H_{0,KSAU} = 76.05$ km/s/Mpc.
- **Status:** **TENSION (17.3σ vs Planck)**
- **Verdict:** KSAU predicts a *higher* local expansion rate than standard $\Lambda$CDM. This exacerbates the Hubble Tension rather than solving it, but is consistent with Cepheid (SH0ES) directionality ($73.0$).

---

**Summary:** The KSAU framework is **not** a Theory of Everything. It is a **Cosmological Resonance Model** (supported by $S_8$ data) with a phenomenological particle mass sector (supported by effective fits but lacking deep algebraic derivation).
