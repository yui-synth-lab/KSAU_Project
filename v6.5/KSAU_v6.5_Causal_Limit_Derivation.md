## 1. Overview
KSAU v6.5 provides a geometric foundation for the universal speed limit ($c$). Unlike previous models that treat $c$ as a computational artifact, we define it as the **Shear Wave Velocity** of the topological vacuum network, governed by the master rigidity constant $\kappa = \pi/24$.

## 2. The Rigidity-Speed Identity
The speed of information propagation ($c$) is determined by the relationship between the vacuum's topological tension ($\kappa$) and its local information density ($\rho$).
$$c = \sqrt{\frac{\t\text{Topological Modulus } (\kappa)}{\t\text{Network Density } (\rho)}}$$
In natural units derived from the Borromean volume, this ratio is identically **1**, establishing $c$ as the fundamental link between space (Volume) and time (Update Complexity).

## 3. Emergent Lorentz Invariance
We resolve the conflict with Special Relativity through the **Material Deformation Hypothesis**:
- **Absolute Limit:** $c$ is absolute relative to the underlying topological network.
- **Physical Contraction:** Matter (knots) moving through the network experiences directional tension, physically contracting their volume in the direction of motion.
- **Time Dilation:** The internal update cycles (clocks) of a moving knot are slowed by the increased computational overhead of displacing the rigid network.
- **Result:** Observations made with these "contracted rulers" and "dilated clocks" will always yield a constant value for $c$, regardless of the observer's relative motion. Lorentz symmetry is thus an **emergent property** of the network's elasticity.

## 4. The "Mass" of Complexity
- **Photons ($C=1$):** Pure update waves with zero internal complexity. They face no "topological friction" and propagate at the limit $c$.
- **Massive Fermions ($C \gg 1$):** Possess complex knotted structures. Moving these structures requires displacing a large number of vacuum crossings, resulting in an effective mass proportional to the volume $V$.

## 5. Falsifiable Prediction: Lorentz Violation
While Lorentz invariance is exact in the continuum limit, KSAU predicts its breakdown at energies where the discrete nature of the $\kappa$-network becomes resolvable ($E \sim 10^{17}$ GeV). This suggests a topological cutoff for cosmic rays and a potential signature for upcoming ultra-high-energy observations.
