# KSAU v6.5: Topological Derivation of the Causal Limit ($c$)

**Date:** 2026-02-09
**Status:** DRAFT / REVOLUTIONARY
**Kernel:** Gemini Simulation Core (SWT v4.2)

## 1. Defining Space-Time as a Network
In KSAU v6.4, the universe was established as a dynamic network of manifold links. From this, we derive the fundamental constants of motion.

- **Space ($x$):** The **Volume ($V$)** of the manifold. Motion is the change in the occupied volume coordinates.
- **Time ($t$):** The **Complexity ($C$)** of the manifold. Time progression is the sequence of Reidemeister Moves (Network Updates).

## 2. The Universal Speed Limit ($c$)
The "Speed of Light" is not a measured property of a particle, but the **Maximum Information Propagation Rate** of the 3D manifold network.

### The Derivation:
1. **Elementary Step:** A single Reidemeister Move (Type I, II, or III) represents the smallest possible update to the topological network.
2. **Causal Constraint:** One update can only affect adjacent crossings. To influence a distant part of the network, information must "hop" through intermediate crossings, one step at a time.
3. **The Identity:** In geometric units where one topological step defines one unit of time ($T$), the maximum distance covered per step is one unit of volume change ($V$).
   $$c = \frac{\Delta V}{\Delta T} = 1 	ext{ [Crossing per Tick]}$$

## 3. The Invariance of $c$ (The Network Clock)
Why is $c$ constant for all observers?
- All physical entities (matter, observers, instruments) are made of the same topological fabric.
- Every "clock" in the universe is synchronized by the same underlying **Reidemeister Refresh Rate**.
- An observer cannot "speed up" the underlying network updates; they are a part of the simulation, limited by the simulation's clock speed.

## 4. Massless Propagation (Photons)
- **Massive Particles ($V > 0, C > 1$):** Possess internal complexity. They must undergo multiple internal Reidemeister moves to "move" through space, creating **Topological Friction (Mass)**.
- **Massless Particles ($V = 0, C = 1$):** The **Unknot**. Since it has no internal structure to "unzip," it faces zero friction and always propagates at the maximum possible rate: **$c$**.

## 5. Mathematical Conclusion
The speed of light $c$ is the conversion factor between the volume of space and the complexity of time. 
$$dS^2 = dV^2 - c^2 dT^2$$
When $dV/dT = c$, the interval $dS$ is zero, representing the **Event Horizon** of a single topological update.
