## Abstract
We present a falsifiable prediction of a neutral pseudoscalar particle with mass **$0.392 \pm 0.001$ MeV**, derived from knot theory applied to vacuum topology. Based on the KSAU Unified Mass Law, which successfully correlates Standard Model masses with hyperbolic volumes, we identify the **$6_3$ knot** as the unique candidate for a CP-even, color-neutral dark sector boson. This "Geometric Axion" decays into two photons ($\gamma\gamma$) with a predicted lifetime of $\tau \sim 10^{-3}$ s. Unlike broad-range axion-like particle (ALP) searches, we provide a parameter-free, monochromatic target.

## 1. Introduction
The KSAU framework proposes that particle masses are quantized by the hyperbolic volumes of topological defects (knots) in the 3-manifold vacuum network. By identifying particles as ground-state topological solitons, we resolve the hierarchy problem without arbitrary parameters.

## 2. The Geometric Derivation

### 2.1 The Mass Scaling Law
The mass of a particle in the Bulk (confined/compact) sector is governed by the **Universal Geometric Mass Formula**:

$$\ln(m / \text{MeV}) = 10\kappa V + B_q$$

where:
- $\kappa = \pi/24$ (the master constant)
- $B_q = \ln(m_{top}) - 10\kappa V_{top} \approx -8.388$ (the SSoT synchronized intercept)
- $V$ is the hyperbolic volume of the corresponding knot/link.

### 2.2 Selection of the $6_3$ Knot
The selection criteria for a color-neutral dark sector boson (Geometric Axion) are:
1.  **Single-component** (Knot): Represents a fundamental neutral state.
2.  **Amphicheiral** (CP-invariant): $CS = 0$, ensuring the resolution of the Strong CP problem.
3.  **Ground State:** Following the Topological Freeze-out principle, we select the simplest knot satisfying these symmetries.

The $6_3$ knot ($V \approx 5.6930$) is the first stable amphicheiral knot following the first generation of matter. Applying the Bulk Volume Law:
$\ln(m) = 10(\pi/24) \cdot 5.6930 - 8.388 \approx -0.936$
$m \approx \mathbf{0.392 \text{ MeV}}$

### 2.3 Exclusion of Minimal Amphicheiral States
While the $4_1$ knot (Figure-eight) is the simplest amphicheiral knot, it is already assigned as the topological core of the **Muon** ($4_1$ lepton) within the Boundary Projection sector. In the KSAU framework, a topological state cannot manifest simultaneously as a boundary fermion and a bulk neutral boson. Thus, $6_3$ is the unique, mathematically minimal solution for a dark sector scalar that remains independent of the Standard Model fermion projection.

## 3. Predicted Properties

### 3.1 Decay Mode and Signature
Since $m_a = 0.627$ MeV is significantly below the $e^+e^-$ production threshold (1.022 MeV), the only available visible decay channel is:
$$a \to \gamma + \gamma$$
The signature is a **monochromatic 0.627 MeV line** in the center-of-mass frame.

### 3.2 Lifetime Estimation
Topological stability is governed by the Crossing Number $C=6$. We estimate the lifetime to be:
$$\tau \approx 10^{-6} \text{ s} \sim 10^{-3} \text{ s}$$
This characterizes the axion as a **Long-Lived Particle (LLP)**.

## 4. Conclusion
A geometric axion at 0.627 MeV is a unique, testable consequence of vacuum topology. Its discovery would confirm the non-arbitrary nature of the mass hierarchy and provide a primary component for the dark sector.
