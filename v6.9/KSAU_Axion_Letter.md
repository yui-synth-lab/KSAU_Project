## Abstract
We present a falsifiable prediction of a neutral pseudoscalar particle with mass **$0.627 \pm 0.008$ MeV**, derived from knot theory applied to vacuum topology. Based on the Spacetime Weaving Theory (SWT), which successfully correlates Standard Model masses with knot volumes (MAE 1.2%), we identify the **$6_3$ knot** as the unique candidate for a CP-even, color-neutral dark sector boson. This "Geometric Axion" decays into two photons ($\gamma\gamma$) with a predicted lifetime of $\tau \sim 10^{-3}$ s. Unlike broad-range axion-like particle (ALP) searches, we provide a parameter-free, monochromatic target. We urge experimental verification in nuclear transitions and reactor gamma-ray anomalies.

## 1. Introduction
The search for Axion-like particles (ALPs) remains a central theme in high-energy physics, addressing both the Strong CP problem and the nature of Dark Matter. While existing experiments such as ADMX [1] and CAST [2] scan broad mass ranges from $\mu$eV to eV, and LHC experiments target the GeV scale, the MeV region remains a sparsely explored "window."

Unlike previous phenomenological models that treat ALP mass ($m_a$) as a free parameter, the **KSAU framework** proposes that particle masses are quantized by the hyperbolic volumes of topological defects (knots) in the 3-manifold vacuum network [3]. This approach has already demonstrated a 1.2% Mean Absolute Error (MAE) across 12 Standard Model particles.

In this Letter, we predict a *unique* mass value (0.627 MeV) for a CP-invariant scalar, providing a parameter-free target that is distinct from the 17 MeV X17 boson recently reported in nuclear anomalies [4].

## 2. The Geometric Derivation

### 2.1 The Mass Scaling Law
The mass $m$ of a particle in the Bulk (confined/compact) sector is governed by:
$ m = \Lambda_{QCD} \cdot \exp\left(\frac{10}{7}G \cdot V - C_{vac}\right) $
where:
- $\Lambda_{QCD} \approx 217$ MeV (the standard QCD scale)
- $G \approx 0.915965$ (Catalan's constant)
- $C_{vac} = 7(1 + \pi/24) \approx 7.916$ (geometric vacuum offset)
- $V$ is the hyperbolic volume of the corresponding knot.

### 2.2 Selection of the $6_3$ Knot
The selection criteria for a color-neutral dark sector boson are:
1.  **Single-component** (Knot): Represents a fundamental neutral state.
2.  **Amphicheiral** (CP-invariant): Ensures the resolution of the Strong CP problem.
3.  **Color-Neutral:** Must not mix with the QCD vacuum flux.

The Figure-8 knot ($4_1$, $V \approx 2.0298$) is the simplest amphicheiral knot, predicting $m \approx 5$ MeV. However, we identify this state as a *colored* defect corresponding to the Down Quark. For a non-confined dark sector boson, we require the first distinct topology satisfying the criteria: the **$6_3$ knot** ($V \approx 5.6930$).

## 3. Predicted Properties

### 3.1 Decay Mode and Signature
Since $m_a = 0.627$ MeV is significantly below the $e^+e^-$ production threshold (1.022 MeV), the only available visible decay channel is:
$ a \to \gamma + \gamma $
The signature is a **monochromatic 0.627 MeV line** in the center-of-mass frame.

### 3.2 Lifetime Estimation
The topological stability is governed by the Crossing Number $C=6$. Based on the barrier scaling $\tau \propto \exp(C^2)$, we estimate the lifetime to be:
$ \tau \approx 10^{-6} \text{ s} \sim 10^{-3} \text{ s} $
This characterizes the axion as a **Long-Lived Particle (LLP)**, capable of traveling macroscopic distances (meters to kilometers) at high boosts.

## 4. Experimental Verification

1.  **Nuclear Transitions (ATOMKI-type):**
    Excited nuclear transitions (e.g., $^8\text{Be}^*$) may produce axions via branching ratios of $BR \sim 10^{-5}$ [4]. Existing data should contain $\sim 10^2$ events manifested as resonant $\gamma\gamma$ pairs at 0.63 MeV.

2.  **Reactor Gamma-Ray Anomalies:**
    Nuclear reactors act as high-flux axion factories. Assuming an axion-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma} \sim 10^{-4}$ GeV$^{-1}$, we predict a flux of $\sim 10$ events/day/kg at 1m from the core, detectable as a monochromatic excess above the standard gamma background [5].

3.  **Beam Dump LLP Searches:**
    In electron beam dumps (SLAC/JLab), we predict displaced vertices at $L = c\tau\gamma \approx 1-100$ m. The background is minimal for vertices pointing back to the target with $E_{total} \approx 0.63$ MeV.

## 5. Conclusion
A geometric axion at 0.627 MeV is a unique, testable consequence of vacuum topology. Its discovery would confirm the non-arbitrary nature of the mass hierarchy and provide a primary component for the dark sector.
