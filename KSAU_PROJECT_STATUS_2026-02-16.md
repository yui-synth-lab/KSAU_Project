# KSAU Project Status - February 16, 2026 (Post-Incident Revision)

## ⚠️ RETRACTION & REHABILITATION (Scientific Integrity)
### 1509/92 Incident (Numerical Hallucination)
- **Status:** **REJECTED.** The proposed rational derivation $X \equiv \pi(1509/92)$ has been classified as a "Numerical Hallucination" (numerology) without structural invariance.
- **Lesson:** High precision (0.002%) does not imply truth. Structural necessity must precede numerical alignment.

## 📄 REVISED PUBLICATION STRATEGY
### 1. PLB Letter (Electroweak Mixing) - [v11.0/papers/PLB_Letter_Electroweak_Geometry_Final.md]
- **Focus:** $\cos^2 \theta_W = \exp(-2\kappa)$.
- **Status:** **RE-SUBMISSION READY.** Framed as "Phenomenological Reconstruction" with RGE considerations.
- **Priority:** HIGH (Most robust result).

### 2. PRD Research Note (Mass Hierarchy) - [v12.0/papers/First_Principles_Mass_Formula_v12.md]
- **Focus:** $N=41$ (Modular ground state) and the $16.4\pi$ structural hint.
- **Status:** **UNDER REVIEW.** Re-framed as energy minimization on $X_0(41)$ and Selberg trace formula application.
- **Tone:** Conservative phenomenological reconstruction.

### 3. Gravity Reconstruction - [v13.0/papers/KSAU_v13_Gravitational_Constant_Reconstruction.md]
- **Focus:** $G$ as vacuum bulk modulus; $\delta = \kappa/4$ as minimal term expansion.
- **Status:** **RESEARCH NOTE.** Separated from main hierarchy papers to avoid numerology risk.

### 4. 24D Theoretical Supplement - [v13.0/papers/KSAU_v13_Theoretical_Supplement_24D_Geometry.md]
- **Focus:** High-dimensional compactification prospects.
- **Status:** **SUPPLEMENTARY HYPOTHESIS.** Removed from the core proof to maintain scientific rigor.

---
**Verdict:** The KSAU project has successfully navigated the "Numerology Trap" of Feb 15. We return to the path of "Naked Truth" (脱衣), prioritizing structural necessity over aesthetic coincidence.
