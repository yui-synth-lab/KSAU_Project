## 1. Abstract
Preliminary investigation into the neutrino sector reveals that experimental mass-squared differences ($\Delta m^2$) are consistent with a geometric hierarchy governed by the Catalan constant $G \approx 0.9160$. By modeling the mass splitting as a sequence of topological phase shifts (holonomies), we identify a "Geometric Resonance" where mass ratios follow clean powers of $e^G$.

## 2. The G-Hierarchy Law for Neutrinos

We propose that neutrino masses $m_1, m_2, m_3$ follow a logarithmic spacing determined by the universal weaving constant $G$:

$$ \ln(m_i) = A_{\nu} + k_i \cdot G $$

### 2.1 Identified Splitting Factors
Analysis of PDG 2024 data (Normal Hierarchy) identifies the following splitting coefficients:
*   **Generation 3-2 Split:** $k_3 - k_2 = \mathbf{1}$
*   **Generation 2-1 Split:** $k_2 - k_1 = \mathbf{1/10}$

This leads to the mass ratio predictions:
*   $m_3/m_2 = e^G \approx 2.499$
*   $m_2/m_1 = e^{G/10} \approx 1.096$

### 2.2 Numerical Verification
Using these ratios to fit the observed $\Delta m^2_{21}$ and $\Delta m^2_{31}$:

| Observable | Experimental (eV²) | Predicted (eV²) | Error |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| $\Delta m^2_{21}$ | $7.41 \times 10^{-5}$ | $7.54 \times 10^{-5}$ | **1.75%** |
| $\Delta m^2_{31}$ | $2.437 \times 10^{-3}$ | $2.437 \times 10^{-3}$ | (Reference) |

**Resulting Absolute Masses:**
*   $m_1 \approx 0.0194$ eV
*   $m_2 \approx 0.0212$ eV
*   $m_3 \approx 0.0530$ eV
*   **$\sum m_\nu \approx 0.0937$ eV** (Consistent with Planck 2018 limit: $< 0.12$ eV)

## 3. Physical Interpretation: 10D Holonomy

The appearance of $1$ and $1/10$ as splitting coefficients provides a direct link to the underlying geometry:
1.  **k=1 (The Catalan Weave):** Represents the fundamental winding density of a 1-cycle ($S^1$) in a 10D Calabi-Yau manifold.
2.  **k=1/10 (The Dimensional Normalization):** Represents the projection of the 10D geometric phase onto a single spatial dimension.

Unlike quarks (volume-driven) and charged leptons (crossing-driven), neutrinos correspond to the **Unknot ground state**, where the only available degree of freedom is the geometric phase (holonomy) accumulated along the $S^1$ fiber.

## 4. Conclusion & Next Steps
The alignment of neutrino data with the $G$ and $G/10$ scales suggests that the KSAU framework is applicable to the nearly-massless neutral sector. Future work (v4.2) will attempt to derive the base scale $A_\nu$ from the **Holographic Suppression Law** ($A_\nu \approx C_l - 4\pi$).
