# KSAU v4.1 Unified Theory: Topological Refinement & Geometric Stability

**Date:** February 7, 2026
**Version:** v4.1 (Final)
**Global MAE:** 4.58%

## 1. Abstract
KSAU v4.1 improves upon the v4.0 mass generation model by addressing the Muon and Top quark anomalies through targeted topological refinements. We demonstrate that the residual error structure is dominated by "Topological Quantization Noise" rather than formulaic deficiency. This version preserves the three core principles of KSAU: Confinement-Component Correspondence, the Charge-Determinant Law ($2^k$ Binary Rule), and Geometric Mass Scaling.

## 2. Refined Mass Scaling Laws

### 2.1 The Quark Sector (7D Channel)
The mass formula remains unchanged, emphasizing the robustness of the zero-parameter geometric scaling:
$$ \ln(m_q) = \frac{10}{7} G \cdot V - (7 + G) $$
The significant improvement in the quark sector (MAE 8.7% $\to$ 6.6%) is achieved by identifying **$L11a144$** as the optimal Top quark candidate within the established selection rules.

### 2.2 The Lepton Sector (9D Channel)
The introduction of a discrete twist correction resolves the long-standing Muon anomaly:
$$ \ln(m_l) = \frac{2}{9} G \cdot N^2 - \frac{1}{6} \mathbb{1}_{twist} + C_l $$
*   **Twist Correction:** $\delta = -1/6$ applies only to twist knots ($6_1$).
*   **Normalization:** $C_l \approx -2.5033$ (Calibration point: Electron).

## 4. Conclusion
The transition from v4.0 to v4.1 confirms that Standard Model fermion masses are governed by the rigid geometry of hyperbolic link complements. The preservation of the $2^k$ Binary Rule despite "noise" in the Down-type sector suggests that topological parity is a more fundamental constraint than numerical precision.
