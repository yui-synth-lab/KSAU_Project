**hypothesis: 24D vacuum compactification as origin of knot-mass correspondence**

Add theoretical conjecture on the geometric origin of KSAU framework.

If a 24-dimensional structure (Niemeier lattice) determines the vacuum, and 4D spacetime emerges from it, the remaining dimensions may be "trapped" as knots in 3D space. The complexity of this trapping — measured by hyperbolic volume — becomes mass.

This explains:
- Why Electron (torus knot, V=0) has the smallest mass: simplest trapping
- Why Muon (minimal hyperbolic knot) is the critical point: first emergence of geometric complexity
- Why the √7 → 13 transition marks a phase boundary: torus phase to hyperbolic phase
- Why 3D is special: knots only exist in 3 dimensions

The universe may be a 24-dimensional structure that appears 3-dimensional because that is the only dimension where the trapped geometry — and therefore mass — can be observed.

Not yet provable. Consistent with all KSAU v7.1 data.
