# KSAU Unified Framework: The Geometry of Everything

## 🏛️ Core Axiom: The 24D Fluidic Vacuum
The universe is a 24-dimensional modular fluid (Leech lattice). Matter is a knot, Force is a link, and Time is the unknotting process.

## ⚖️ The Dimensional Selection Law (v15.1 Discovery)
Why is the universe 3-dimensional space and 4-dimensional spacetime? The KSAU-Quantum Gear integration provides the first-principles derivation:

### 1. The Time Ignition Condition (Why 3D Space?)
Dynamic processing (Time) can only emerge if the local connectivity $d$ (Kissing Number) exceeds the unknotting threshold $d_c = \pi^2 \approx 9.87$.
- **$K(1)=2, K(2)=6$**: Below threshold. Geometry is **Frozen** (Static).
- **$K(3)=12$**: First integer dimension to exceed $\pi^2$. 
- **Conclusion**: 3D is the **minimal ignition dimension** for time.

### 2. The Stability Resonance Condition (Why 4D Spacetime?)
Spacetime stabilizes when the information density per node matches the circular phase $\pi$ via the spectral weight $\kappa = \pi/24$.
- **Resonance Identity**: $K(4) \cdot \kappa = 24 \cdot (\pi/24) = \pi$
- **Conclusion**: 4D is the **unique resonant dimension** where vacuum information is perfectly partitioned.

## 🌀 Topo-Mass Correspondence
Mass is the "drag" created by unknotting resistance. 
- **Electron ($V=0$)**: Simplest trapping (Torus phase).
- **Muon ($V_{min}$)**: First emergence of hyperbolic complexity.
- **Phase Transition**: The irrational-to-integer transition ($\sqrt{7} \to 13$) marks the boundary where knots become "locked" in 3D space.
