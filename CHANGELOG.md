# KSAU Project: Evolutionary Changelog (v2.2 to v4.0)

This document tracks the transformative journey of the Knot-Structure-At-Universal (KSAU) theory from an empirical search to a first-principles geometric framework.

---

## [v4.0] - 2026-02-06 (Current Milestone)
### "The Geometric Unification"
**Major Breakthrough:** Total elimination of arbitrary fitting parameters. The theory now relies exclusively on geometric constants and spacetime dimensionality.

- **Geometric Constants:** Replaced empirical coefficients ($\gamma, b'$) with the **Catalan Constant ($G$)** and dimensional ratios ($10/7, 2/9$).
- **The Borromean Discovery:** Identified the **Down Quark** as the **Borromean Rings** ($L6a4$), with a volume of exactly **$8G$**.
- **Confinement Correspondence:** Established that Quarks are represented by **Links** (confined) and Leptons by **Knots** (free).
- **The Third Principle:** Discovered the **Binary Determinant Rule** ($Det = 2^k$), explaining why specific link volumes are "chosen" by nature.
- **Lepton Mapping:** Identified Electron ($3_1$) and Tau ($7_1$) as torus knots, and Muon ($6_1$) as a twist knot sharing the $3^2$ determinant pattern.
- **Accuracy:** Global MAE = **8.0%** with **zero continuous tuning parameters**.

## [v3.4] - 2026-02-06
### "The Occam Update"
- **Strange Refinement:** Corrected the Strange quark assignment from $L11n345$ to **$L10n95$** (MAE improved from 8.76% to 8.38%).
- **Statistical Shield:** Introduced rigorous validation including Bootstrap Analysis ($N=10,000$) and Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation (LOO-CV).
- **Uniqueness:** Exhaustive search confirmed $L10n95$ as the global minimum for the Strange mass slot.

## [v3.3] - 2026-01-xx
### "Brute Force Foundations"
- **Systematic Search:** Conducted high-performance brute force search through LinkInfo database.
- **Universal Map:** Created the first map connecting crossing numbers directly to the quark hierarchy.
- **MAE Milestone:** Achieved sub-10% error for the first time (8.76%).

---

## [v2.4] - 2025-xx-xx
### "The Unified Prototype"
- **9-Particle Integration:** First attempt to plot Quarks and Leptons on a single unified scale.
- **Theoretical Supplement:** Initial exploration of Chern-Simons connections and hyperbolic 3-manifolds.

---

## [v2.3] - 2025-xx-xx
### "Candidate Selection Refinement"
- **Bayesian Evidence:** Introduced Bayesian probability tests to compare different knot assignment sets.
- **Clustering Analysis:** Identified topological "neighborhoods" in the mass spectrum.

---

## [v2.2] - 2025-xx-xx
### "Early Exploration"
- **Baseline:** Used $L11n345$ for Strange and initial $V$ vs $\ln(m)$ fits.
- **Limitations:** High reliance on empirical regression; magic numbers ($1.302, -7.89$) lacked geometric meaning.
- **Status:** "Numerical Pattern Recognition" phase.

---

## Summary of Growth
- **v2.2:** "It fits." (MAE ~10%, Magic Numbers)
- **v3.4:** "It's robust." (MAE 8.38%, Statistical Significance)
- **v4.0:** "It's Geometry." (MAE 8.0%, Zero Parameters, Borromean Identity)
