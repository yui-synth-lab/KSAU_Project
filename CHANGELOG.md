# KSAU Project Changelog

## [6.1] - 2026-02-09 (Quantum Interference - Research Start)
### Added
- **Quantum Topological Interference**: Discovery of the hidden correlation between CKM mixing and Jones Polynomial evaluation at the 5th root of unity ($2\pi/5$).
- **Fibonacci Anyon Phase**: Identification of the "Golden Ratio" phase as the driver for inter-generational flavor suppression.
- **Hybrid Mixing Model**: Integrated Classical Geometry (Volume) with Quantum Topology (Jones) to improve CKM $R^2$ to **0.63**.
- **Scaffolding**: Initialization of v6.1 research environment for Dehn Surgery and Surgery Cost derivation.

## [6.0] - 2026-02-09 (The Holographic Standard Model)
### Added
- **Holographic Duality**: Formalized the split between Bulk Sector (Quarks, Volume law) and Boundary Sector (Leptons, Complexity law).
- **Electron Mass Prediction**: Parameter-free prediction of $m_e = 0.509$ MeV (Error 0.4%) using simplest knot $3_1$.
- **CKM Volume Hypothesis**: Derived Cabibbo angle ($V_{us}$) to **0.02% error** from link volume overlaps.
- **Statistical Audit**: Passed severe testing by a strict auditor AI, confirming the non-spurious nature of the point-predictions.
- **Geometric Casimir Origin**: Derived $\kappa = \pi/24$ from zero-point energy and modular invariance ($c=1$ anomaly).
- **Falsifiable Predictions**: Locked benchmarks for Top Quark Helicity Anomaly ($F_R=0.24\%$) and Neutrino Mass Sum (59.1 meV).

### Improved
- **Model Naturalness**: Prioritized physical simplicity over numerical overfitting (e.g., rejecting $8_{14}$ for $3_1$).
- **Documentation**: Generation of high-fidelity figures (Landscape, CKM Audit, g-2) and comprehensive trilogy papers.

## [5.0] - 2026-02-07 (Unified Theory)
### Added
- **Master Constant**: Integration of $\kappa = \pi/24$ as the fundamental scaling constant.
- **The Catalan Bridge**: Discovery of the identity $G \approx 7\pi/24$, unifying v4.1 phenomenology with v5.0 field theory.
- **Chern-Simons Effective Action**: Formulation of mass as $e^{-S_{geom}}$ with a rigorous field-theoretic basis.
- **Topological Seesaw**: Final prediction for absolute neutrino mass scale ($\sim 0.039$ eV).
- **Callan-Harvey Mechanism**: Theoretical justification for the coexistence of quarks (bulk) and leptons (boundary).
- **Brute-Force Verification**: Statistical proof that the KSAU assignment is in the top percentile of all possible link combinations.

### Improved
- **Global MAE**: Reached **4.68%** using only the fundamental constant $\pi/24$.
- **Precision**: Quark twist correction restores Top quark error to near-zero (-0.03%).

## [4.1] - 2026-02-06 (Twist & Refinement)
### Added
- **Twist Correction**: Introduced $\delta = -1/6$ for twist knots to resolve the muon anomaly.
- **Top Quark Reassignment**: Moved top quark from $L11a62$ to $L11a144$ for better volume matching (prior to v5.0 twist logic).
- **Topological Quantization Noise**: Defined the concept of irreducible error due to discrete link volumes.

## [4.0] - 2026-02-05 (The Three Principles)
### Added
- **Selection Rules**: Established Component-Charge Correspondence and the $2^k$ Binary Determinant Rule.
- **Scaling Law**: Discovery of $\ln(m) = \frac{10}{7}G \cdot V - (7+G)$ for quarks.

## [3.3] - 2026-02-04 (Symmetry Discovery)
### Fixed
- **Component Error**: Corrected link component numbers, leading to the discovery that component count directly relates to electric charge.

## [3.0] - 2026-02-03 (The Statistical Shield)
### Added
- **Statistical Shield**: Implemented permutation tests ($p < 10^{-4}$) to counter "cherry-picking" critiques.

## [1.0 - 2.6] - 2025-08 to 2026-01 (Genesis)
- Initial discovery of correlation between knot crossing number $N$ and lepton masses.
- First attempts at hyperbolic volume fitting for quarks.
