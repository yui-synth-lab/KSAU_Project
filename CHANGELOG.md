## [6.0.1] - 2026-02-11 (Maintenance & Bug Fixes)
### Fixed
- **Topology Assignment Generation**: Refactored `topology_official_selector.py` to algorithmically generate assignments instead of hardcoding, improving reproducibility.
- **Data Schema Consistency**: Fixed key references in `robustness_check.py`, `dark_matter_search.py` (`'mass_mev'` → `'observed_mass'`).
- **Data Loading**: Updated `plot_topological_landscape.py` to use unified data loader (`ksau_config.load_topology_assignments()`).
- **Theory Constants**: Computed `CL_DEFAULT` from theory formula instead of hardcoding for consistency with `BQ_DEFAULT`.

### Improved
- **Accuracy**: Grand Unified MAE improved from 1.20% to **0.78%** through algorithmic topology selection (Bottom: -5.79% → -1.22%, Top: -0.79% → -0.30%).
- **Code Quality**: All v6.0 analysis scripts (`paper_I_validation.py`, `analyze_ckm_full.py`, etc.) verified and tested successfully.
