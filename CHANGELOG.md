# KSAU Project Changelog

## [5.0] - 2026-02-07 (Unified Theory)
### Added
- **Master Constant**: Integration of $\kappa = \pi/24$ as the fundamental scaling constant.
- **The Catalan Bridge**: Discovery of the identity $G \approx 7\pi/24$, unifying v4.1 phenomenology with v5.0 field theory.
- **Chern-Simons Effective Action**: Formulation of mass as $e^{-S_{geom}}$ with a rigorous field-theoretic basis.
- **Topological Seesaw**: Final prediction for absolute neutrino mass scale ($\sim 0.039$ eV).
- **Callan-Harvey Mechanism**: Theoretical justification for the coexistence of quarks (bulk) and leptons (boundary).
- **Brute-Force Verification**: Statistical proof that the KSAU assignment is in the top percentile of all possible link combinations.

### Improved
- **Global MAE**: Reached **4.68%** using only the fundamental constant $\pi/24$.
- **Precision**: Quark twist correction restores Top quark error to near-zero (-0.03%).

## [4.1] - 2026-02-06 (Twist & Refinement)
### Added
- **Twist Correction**: Introduced $\delta = -1/6$ for twist knots to resolve the muon anomaly.
- **Top Quark Reassignment**: Moved top quark from $L11a62$ to $L11a144$ for better volume matching (prior to v5.0 twist logic).
- **Topological Quantization Noise**: Defined the concept of irreducible error due to discrete link volumes.

## [4.0] - 2026-02-05 (The Three Principles)
### Added
- **Selection Rules**: Established Component-Charge Correspondence and the $2^k$ Binary Determinant Rule.
- **Scaling Law**: Discovery of $\ln(m) = \frac{10}{7}G \cdot V - (7+G)$ for quarks.

## [3.3] - 2026-02-04 (Symmetry Discovery)
### Fixed
- **Component Error**: Corrected link component numbers, leading to the discovery that component count directly relates to electric charge.

## [3.0] - 2026-02-03 (The Statistical Shield)
### Added
- **Statistical Shield**: Implemented permutation tests ($p < 10^{-4}$) to counter "cherry-picking" critiques.

## [1.0 - 2.6] - 2025-08 to 2026-01 (Genesis)
- Initial discovery of correlation between knot crossing number $N$ and lepton masses.
- First attempts at hyperbolic volume fitting for quarks.
