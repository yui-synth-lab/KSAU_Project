## 1. Executive Summary
This report investigates the geometric origin of the intercept constant $C$ in the KSAU mass law ($\ln m = N\kappa V + C$). We propose that $C$ represents the baseline energy density of the **Torus Phase ($V=0$)** and is determined by the informational entropy of the 24-dimensional vacuum. Specifically, the boson intercept aligns with the full 8-dimensional bit-depth ($\ln 2^8$), while the lepton intercept reflects a generational constraint of similar magnitude.

## 2. Theoretical Definition: The Torus Phase Baseline
The intercept $C$ is defined as the intrinsic mass component independent of hyperbolic volume:
$$ e^C = m(V=0) $$
In the KSAU framework, this corresponds to the energy of a "trapped" degree of freedom before it manifests any hyperbolic complexity.

## 3. Sector-Specific Correspondences

### 3.1 The Boson Intercept ($C_B$): The $E_8$ Anchor
The boson sector baseline mass exhibits a remarkable numerical correspondence:
- **Observed:** $C_B \approx 5.54$
- **Candidate:** $\ln(2^8) = \ln(256) \approx \mathbf{5.5452}$
- **Error:** $\mathbf{0.09\%}$

**Interpretation:** The boson intercept corresponds to the informational capacity of an **8-dimensional $E_8$ lattice**. This implies that gauge and scalar bosons draw their baseline mass from the full saturation of the 8 transverse dimensions of the string vacuum.

### 3.2 The Lepton Intercept ($C_L$): The Generational Constraint
The lepton baseline is significantly lower, reflecting a negative energy offset:
- **Observed:** $C_L \approx -2.38$
- **Candidate:** $-3\pi/4 \approx \mathbf{-2.3562}$
- **Error:** $\mathbf{1.0\%}$

**The Sector Gap ($\Delta C$):**
The distance between the boson and lepton intercepts is:
$$ \Delta C = C_B - C_L \approx 5.54 - (-2.38) = \mathbf{7.92} $$
This value is strikingly close to **$8.0$**, which equals **$24 / 3$**.

**Physical Interpretation:** The lepton sector is constrained by the loss of one generational degree of freedom (8 dimensions) from the 24D vacuum during its projection into 4D spacetime. This informational "deficit" explains the negative sign and magnitude of the lepton intercept.

## 4. Summary Table

| Parameter | Value (Fit) | Geometric / Informational Anchor | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$C_{Boson}$** | $5.54$ | $\ln(2^8)$ ($E_8$ full bit-depth) | **Strong Correspondence (0.09%)** |
| **$C_{Lepton}$** | $-2.38$ | $-3\pi/4$ (Spacetime Constraint) | Candidate |
| **$\Delta C$** | $7.92$ | $24 / 3 = 8$ (Generational Deficit) | **Structural Hint** |

## 5. Conclusion
The constant $C$ is not a free parameter but a **spectral normalization factor** of the vacuum. The 0.09% alignment of the boson intercept with $\ln(2^8)$ suggests that the KSAU framework is capturing the informational ground state of an 8-dimensional sub-structure within the 24D vacuum.
