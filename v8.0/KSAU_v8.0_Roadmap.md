## 1. Objective: Beyond Static Constants to Stochastic Dynamics
The primary goal of v8.0 is to evolve from the static geometric law $\kappa = \pi/24$ toward a **Stochastic Spacetime Fluid (TBD Model)**. We aim to unify the fermion and boson sectors by interpreting the hyperbolic volume $V$ as a dynamical "excluded volume" within a 24D Brownian flow.

## 2. Priority 1: Temporal Brownian Dynamics (TBD) Integration
- **Concept:** Spacetime is a fluid with viscosity $\kappa = \pi/24$. Time is a stochastic process.
- **Task 1 (Emergence):** Prove that the speed of light $c$ emerges as the saturation limit of information diffusion in a 24D Leech-Lattice-based random walk.
- **Task 2 (Mass as Drag):** Derivation of the mass formula $m = N \kappa V$ from the Stokes-Einstein relation in the 24D vacuum fluid.
- **Task 3 (Flavor Reconnection):** Model CKM/PMNS mixing as stochastic reconnection events of topological vortices (knots).

## 3. Priority 2: Running $\kappa$ Hypothesis (v8.0 Core)
- **Problem:** Fermions follow $\kappa \approx 0.13$ while Bosons follow $k_{eff} \approx 0.40$. A static geometric law cannot reconcile this difference.
- **Hypothesis:** The "Trapped 24D degrees of freedom" exhibit scale-dependent coupling. As the complexity (Volume) increases, the effective spectral weight $\kappa$ evolves according to a Modular Renormalization Group (RG) flow.
- **Goal:** Derive a function $\kappa(V)$ such that $\kappa(V_{fermion}) \approx \pi/24$ and $\kappa(V_{boson}) \approx 10/24$ (or similar).

## 3. Priority 2: Geometric Derivation of Quark N values (v8.0/v9.0)
- **Problem:** Quark degeneracy factors ($N=3, 6, 12, 60$) are empirical.
- **Approach:** Map the 24-dimensional Niemeier lattice symmetries to the flavor subgroups. 
- **Hypothesis:** $N$ values are the ranks of the stabilizer subgroups of the 24D vacuum under projection onto the specific knot holonomy.
- **Goal:** Eliminate all manually fitted $N$ values from the Standard Model assignments.

## 4. Priority 3: Non-Abelian Torsion Refinement (v9.0+)
- **Focus:** Investigating Twisted Alexander Polynomials for the Tau and heavier states.
- **Status:** On hold to prevent ad-hoc fitting; will be revisited after the Running $\kappa$ framework is stabilized.

## 5. Implementation Strategy
1. **[Data]** Extract precise Boson (W, Z, Higgs) mass and volume data into `v8.0/data/`.
2. **[Math]** Research "Modular Flow" and "Holomorphic Anomalies" in the context of Dedekind\eta weight evolution.
3. **[Simulation]** Fit the Running $\kappa$ curve using the combined Fermion-Boson dataset.
4. **[Audit]** Strictly separate "Correlation" from "Causation" as per `GEMINI.md`.
