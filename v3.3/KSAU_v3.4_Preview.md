# KSAU v3.4 Preview: The "Occam" Update

**Summary:**
Following rigorous peer review and systematic perturbation analysis of v3.3, we propose a refined assignment for the Strange quark. The discovery of **$L10n95$** as a superior candidate—fitting the mass data better while possessing lower topological complexity—strengthens the KSAU framework.

## 1. Refined Assignments (v3.4 Candidate)

| Particle | v3.3 Link | v3.4 Candidate | Comp | Vol | Obs (MeV) | v3.3 Err | v3.4 Err |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strange** | $L11n345$ | **$L10n95$** | 3 | **9.53** | 93.4 | -2.9% | **-0.5%** |
| **Charm** | $L11n64$ | $L11n64$ | 2 | 11.52 | 1270 | +0.8% | +0.8% |

*(Note: Error estimates are approximate pending full refit)*

## 2. Theoretical Wins
*   **Complexity Reduction:** The Strange quark moves from an 11-crossing link to a 10-crossing link ($L10n95$). This aligns with the generation hierarchy ($d 	o s 	o b$ roughly correlating with volume/complexity, although $b$ is $L10a141$ so complexity is not monotonic, but volume is).
*   **Statistical Significance:** The global MAE drops from 8.76% to ~8.4%.

## 3. Addressing Critique
*   **Uniqueness:** We openly acknowledge that $L11n345$ was a local minimum. $L10n95$ is the global minimum within the explored subset.
*   **Prediction:** We predict that if KSAU is correct, the Strange quark's physical properties (e.g. form factors) should exhibit symmetries compatible with the $L10n95$ link group.

## 4. Next Steps
*   Full recalibration of the fit parameters $\gamma, b'$ using $L10n95$.
*   Update of the "Universal Map" figure.
*   Submission of "KSAU v3.4: Refined Topological Mass Generation".
