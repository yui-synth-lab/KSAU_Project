# KSAU v6.3 Phase 1: SUSY Mirror Symmetry Report

**Date:** 2026-02-09


## 1. Supersymmetry as Mirror Symmetry
- **Objective:** Identify Sparticles as topological mirror images ($K^*$) of standard knots ($K$).
- **Geometric Origin:** 
  - Standard Mass: $m \sim \exp(A \cdot V + B \cdot CS)$
  - Sparticle Mass: $m^* \sim \exp(A \cdot V - B \cdot CS)$
- **Mass Splitting:** The mass gap between a particle and its sparticle is driven by the **Chern-Simons invariant ($CS$)**, which changes sign under parity (mirroring).

## 2. Quantitative Results (Preliminary)
- **Assumed Background Coupling:** $B = 1.0$.
- **Stop (S-Top) Prediction:**
  - Standard Top ($V=15.36$, $CS=0.05$): 205 GeV (Calculated).
  - Mirror Stop ($V=15.36$, $CS=-0.05$): 185 GeV.
- **The Hierarchy Problem:** To push S-particles to the **TeV scale** (consistent with LHC null results), the coupling $B$ must be significantly larger ($B \approx 17.5$). 
- **Physical Interpretation:** The background time-space has a high "Topological Viscosity" (large $B$), which penalizes mirror-image configurations, making the SUSY sector much heavier than the SM sector.

## 3. Symmetry Restoration (Amphicheiral Particles)
- **Observation:** Amphicheiral particles (where $K = K^*$ and $CS = 0$) do not undergo SUSY splitting.
- **Prediction:** The **Electron Neutrino ($
u_e = 4_1$)** and **Tau Neutrino ($
u_	au = 8_9$)** are their own sparticles (Symmetry Restored). This predicts that their scalar counterparts (Sneutrinos) are degenerate in mass with the neutrinos, or the distinction vanishes.

## 4. Next Steps (Phase 2 Preview)
- **Gravity (Planck Scale):** Investigate the $V 	o 0$ limit for "Self-Dual" knots to derive the Planck length.
- **Sparticle Search:** Scan the database for knots that are "Purely Mirror" (not found in SM) as candidates for gravitinos.
